During this week&amp;rsquo;s show, there were some major technical difficulties. The Network&amp;rsquo;s signal was severely disrupted for unknown reasons. The GOOCroo was on it, but it was a serious struggle. At one point, Kate even ended upside-down!

This week, after the previous technical issues the week before, Corporate Sponsor disabled Kate&amp;rsquo;s access to their satellites for the week to give her show a &amp;ldquo;break.&amp;rdquo; Because of this, the Lullaby Lounge went online via backup servers without the Sponsor&amp;rsquo;s permission.
We&amp;rsquo;ve never met, Holly and I. We&amp;rsquo;ve just been friends for a decent amount of time, on the internet.</description></item><item><title>S06E06</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-6/s06e06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-6/s06e06/</guid><description>S06E06 # Corporate Sponsor Presents THE LULLABY LOUNGE NOVELTY HOUR

In a return to normalcy after wresting the show free from the clutches of Corporate Sponsor, Kate brought back an old favorite with a new twist. DICEBREAK! has made many appearances, but this season two additional modifiers were added: A list of four possible genres to transform the song to, different from the normal style of the song, and changing from the usual instrument to electric guitar.</description></item><item><title>S06E08</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-6/s06e08/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/lullaby-lounge/seasons/season-6/s06e08/</guid><description>S06E08 # Ladies Nite at the Lounge
