{{< lyrics >}}
It's so easy to go back
To the life that you once had
It's so god damn hard to change
And the feeling's pretty strange
It's so easy to say yes
To your old conflicted mess
It's like a cheap electric shock
To turn back the clock

Can't you just say no, Bianca?
Can't you let it go, Bianca?
I guess I'll never know, Bianca
The things that you go through

It's like you were never alive
Every step you take's a dive
Into a new uncharted sea
Where we all sit, patiently
Please don't try to run away
We're waiting 'til you're okay
Before you forgive anyone else
You have to forgive yourself

Can't you just say no, Bianca?
Can't you let it go, Bianca?
I guess I'll never know, Bianca
The things that you go through

Maybe I should try to help
Try to break into your shell
Maybe I don't have the balls
To catch Bianca if she falls
Or should I leave you alone
Delete your number off my phone
Stop the games, and leave you be
Bianca, tell me

Can't you just say no, Bianca?
Can't you let it go, Bianca?
I guess I'll never know, Bianca
The things that you go through
