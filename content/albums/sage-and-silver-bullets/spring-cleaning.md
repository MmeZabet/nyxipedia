{{< lyrics >}}
it's been a little while now, the both of us moved on
our love is dust behind us, the passion's dead and gone
and i mean it when i tell you, i hope you're doing well
but I gotta say this, baby, I'd sell my soul to send you straight to hell
i can't recall the moment i decided your fate
perhaps when I was talking to the other woman on your plate
i've never been a side dish, and i didn't take it well
yeah, i gotta tell you, baby, i'd sell my soul to send you straight to hell

you're a looker not a lover
but i'm a fighter so take cover
and i've got the kind of ammo that you can't buy
i'm doing some spring cleanin'
i'm exorcising demons
so bring my whiskey and my guitar cause someone is gonna die

i'd say that i was joking, but i can't say a word
and lying is a sin, my dear, i don't believe you heard
and after all the wrong you did me, i'm trying not to dwell
but i gotta tell you, darling, i'd sell my soul to send you straight to hell

you're a cheater, not a player
but i'm a devil slayer
and you ain't got nothing on the game I'm gonna bring
i'm doing some spring cleanin
i'm exorcising demons
so ring a bell because it's about damn time this angel got her wings

i heard a wise man sayin' the past should stay the past
but if i never looked behind me, i wouldn't know just what i had
i've found a man who loves me and truly treats me well
but i still think about how i'd sell my soul to send you straight to hell
