## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
you have cursed us, mother eve
we regret the things we eat
damned to the eternal fate
despising every bite we ate
poring over each detail
skeletal and deathly pale
compared to every girl we meet,
you have cursed us, mother eve

if the apple'd stayed untouched
would we hate ourselves as much
hungering and never sated
look at the monsters you've created
wretching to prevent our sins
from settling beneath our skin
we would rather weep & heave
you have cursed us, mother eve

the mirror lies, the scale's a whore
i couldn't handle one bite more
it'd be the death of me, i'm sure
if i should take one bite more
the bodies with which we've been blessed
cannot thrive in emptiness
but we have become obsessed
in hollow bones and shallow breasts
we take pride in emptiness

you have cursed us, mother eve
how can i ever believe
that i am not what i eat
you have cursed us, mother eve
you have cursed us, mother eve
