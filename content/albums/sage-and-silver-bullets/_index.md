From Kate:
"Sage & Silver Bullets" is my third record. It was funded by my fans, friends, and family on Kickstarter, a fact I am both proud of and humbled by.

The title, Sage & Silver Bullets, relates to the healing powers inherent in music for me. This, I hope, will be the last record I write about Mr. Domestic Rhapsody. Producing it is burning sage; I'm cleaning out my brain of his presence, but also the presence of my anxiety and depression now voiced by him in my head. "Silver bullets", because I'm very about cowboy/outlaw imagery and I always imagine silver bullets coming from fancy six shooters. They're what you use to kill demons and other monsters; my anxiety is a being that I have to exorcise and slay.
