## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I won't let you break my toys
I know how to beat the boys
Tastes so sweet, your sugar treat
The whole wide world's gonna pop for me

Pop pop pop that bubblegum
Pop pop pop, this is fun
Pop pop pop that bubblegum
You'll be sorry when I'm done

I won't let you bring me down
I know how to win this round
Tastes so sweet, your sugar treat
The whole wide world's gonna pop for me

Pop pop pop that bubblegum
Pop pop pop, (ooh!) this is fun
Pop pop pop that bubblegum
You'll be sorry when I'm done

Come and get me, boys!

Pop pop pop that bubblegum
Pop pop pop, (ooh!) this is fun
Pop pop pop that bubblegum
You'll be sorry when I'm done
