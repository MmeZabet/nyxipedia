## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
(Repeats throughout the song)
Heave ho, heave go
Brittle hearts and broken bones
Chains that rattle, winds that moan
Down you go

(Repeats throughout the song)
Do not underestimate
To this end you seal your fate
Darkest depths of foaming sea
Soon you're hearing 1, 2, 3

(Repeats throughout the song)
Oceanea!
