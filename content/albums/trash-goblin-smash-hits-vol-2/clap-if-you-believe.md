## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
My light is going out
It’s getting darker now
I tried to save you all somehow
But I can’t save myself

I used to be so bright
A star among the night
Illuminating, I’m alright
But now I’ve lost my shine

I’ve been drinking poison far too long and deep
Barreling desperately towards my eternal sleep
I’ve always been there to look before you leap
Now I need you to clap if you believe

I’ve been afraid to ask
But now I’m fading fast
And so at longest last
I’m reaching for your hand

Ive been drinking poison far too sickly sweet
desperately trying not to give in to disease
I’ve always been there to think before you speak
Now I need you to clap if you believe

My light is going dim
They say power is within
So maybe there’s no way to win
This game I never wanted to play.

You say that it’s poison but it tastes like wine to me
I’m just celebrating my continued victory
Successfully regretting the truth I’m bound to bleed
I need you to clap if you believe
