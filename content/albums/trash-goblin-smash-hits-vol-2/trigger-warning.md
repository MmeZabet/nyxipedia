Times up, butter cup, I just had a premonition
Someday soon I’ll confiscate your ammunition
As it turns out, boys like you tend to go crazy
I think that that kinda weapon’s safer with a pretty lady

That’s nice, mister man, sure, I think you’re very smart
But that kind of privilege isn’t for the faint of heart
What if your wife leaves you for a bigger better Tom or Dick
And you go shoot up a school because you can’t handle your shit?

There is a solution
With perfect execution
Im sure you fought it tooth and nail
It is for the best
You fellas need some rest
Because you’re being so typically male

Give me your gun now Sugar just in case
Give me your gun I swear that I’ll keep it safe
I just can’t trust that you know your place
Don’t try to run, the time has come)
give me your gun

if you ask real nice, there’s a way make it better
You just need your wife to send us a formal letter
Actually, on second thought, i don’t think you meet the guidelines
Have a nice day, sweetheart, hope you have better luck next time

Sir, please step aside, there’s no need to raise your voice
Yes, I understand, but you do not have a choice
You don’t comprehend the consequences of your actions
Now hand over your rifle, darlin,
And you stop overreacting

Give me your gun now Sugar just in case
Give me your gun I swear that I’ll keep it safe
I just can’t trust that you know your place
Don’t try to run,what’s done is done
give me your gun
