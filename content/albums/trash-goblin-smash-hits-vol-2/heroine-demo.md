## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
watching as the fire consumes us
waiting, praying for the rain
i want to help but i feel helpless
like there’s nothing i can change

who am i when i’m not giving
who am i when i receive
how am can i just keep on living
watching others as they bleed

i know that i’m supposed to see
a light right there in front of me
but i see only darkness up ahead
i know that i’m supposed to find
someway to keep me peace of mind
but i fear the only peace i’ll find is death

watching as the clock is ticking
waiting, praying for relief,
I can feel my conscience slipping
as I fade back in to sleep

i know that i’m supposed to fight
I know that none of this is right
but I can barely stand on my two feet
i want to be your heroine
I want to love my home again
but this burlesques reveals no part for me

Just what am i supposed to do
When lies have gone and murdered truth
When hearts cannot be heard over the screams
The ghost of our democracy
is not enough to comfort me
And if I must, I’ll fight to live my dream
