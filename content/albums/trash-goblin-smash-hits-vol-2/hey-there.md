{{< lyrics >}}
Hey there, pretty boy
You don't get to make my choice
Hey there, pretty boy
Don't you tread on me

This has been long time coming
And you better speak the truth
When you make a deal with the devil
He is gonna follow you

You can say that we are hunters
I guess that makes you the prey
You can run but you can't hide now
The witches have come out to play

Hey there, pretty boy
You don't get to take my voice
Hey there, pretty boy
Don't you tread on me

You protect the wolf among you
You play blind and grant reprieve
But he howls and bites and growls
And leaves a trail of bloody sheep

You can say that you're our sister
But you speak with silver tongues
You can't tame a wolf or mister
And you'll pay for what you've done

Hey there, pretty girl,
Watch your step, this ainâ€™t our world
Hey there, pretty girl,
Don't you tread on me
