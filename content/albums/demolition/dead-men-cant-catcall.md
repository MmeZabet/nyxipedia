## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Dead man can't whistle at you walking down the road
Dead man can't try to get some tail
Dead man can't slap the ass of a girl that he don't know
Dead man can't prey upon the frail
Dead man can't tell me that I'm prettier when I smile
Can't call me honey on the phone
Dead man can't beg for me to stay a little while
And god knows a dead man can't follow me home
Yes, god knows a dead man can't follow me home

Dead man can't say he's kidding when he's clearly not
Dead man can't try to save his skin
Dead man can't say sorry only when he's been caught
Dead men tell no tales, dead men cannot sin
Dead man can't tell me he's just trying to be nice
He can't yell that I'll end up alone
Dead man can't tell me what I could change to be his type
And god knows a dead man can't follow me home
Yes, god knows a dead man can't follow me home

Dead man can't call me names when I don't have the time to
Try to be polite when I say no
Dead man can't wait until she's too drunk to decline
And god knows a dead man can't follow me home
Yes, god knows a dead man can't follow me home
