when i’m feeling down
like there’s no way up from here
can’t pick myself up off the ground
I am paralyzed by fear
whether it’s just in my head
or maybe it’s something else
when it’s starting to get bad
this is what i ask my self

what would Peggy Carter do?
she’d happily fight anyone who’d gotten in her way
what would peggy carter do?
she wouldn’t listen to what the haters have to say
she would catch all of the bad guys and she’d do it looking great
Peggy Carter is my hero, and she’s why I’m here today

when the patriarchy’s thriving
and the internet is mean
when my depression’s trying to kill me
and I can’t bring myself to eat
when some prick who doesn’t know me
tries to ask me for me name
I just say “My name is Agent”
And I go on with my day

what would Peggy Carter do?
she’d happily fight anyone who’d gotten in her way
what would peggy carter do?
she wouldn’t listen to what the haters have to say
she would catch all of the bad guys and she’d do it looking great
Peggy Carter is my hero, and she’s why I’m here today

whether your boss thinks women are all weak
or your manager won’t even let you speak
just think of Margaret Carter
kick ass in heels and garters
and remember being feminine doesn’t make you any less
than any other person on the street

what would Peggy Carter do?
she’d happily fight anyone who’d gotten in her way
what would peggy carter do?
she wouldn’t listen to what the haters have to say
she would catch all of the bad guys and she’d do it looking great
Peggy Carter is my hero, and she’s why I’m here today
