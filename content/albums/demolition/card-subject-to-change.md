## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
you said that blonde heels have more fun
well, you're living proof
i thought that you were the one
so foolish in my youth

and the victor for the match
well, it's pretty clear
darling, you were such a catch
until you dissappeared

baby i'm a luchador and i learned it from you
i fight for freedom and i fight for the truth
baby i'm a luchador and all because of you
you fool

you said you did your best
well it wasn't good enough
you put me to the test
but you play a little rough

you say i'm green as earth
and fickle as the air
but for what it's worth
i finally don't care

CHORUS

i hate hate
to break kay fabe
but i got to got to got to say
you got me pretty good, baby
i hate hate HATE
to break break break
kay fabe
but the gimmick didn't work
turns out you're just a jerk

CHORUS
