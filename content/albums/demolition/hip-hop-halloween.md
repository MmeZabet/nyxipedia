{{< lyrics >}}
you gave me such a fright, oh isn't it a scream
you look simply horriffic, a walking dead man's dream
your hands are cold and clammy, your skin is white as snow
actually, my lovely, you look like you've seen a ghost!

you're absolutely perfect, can't wait for your suprise
just ring the doorbell, darling, don't forget to close your eyes
if you're really lucky, you might get trapped inside
because as far as i have heard, no one has survived

welcome to the end of world
didn't think we'd be here so soon
welcome to the end of the world
we're so happy to see you

they say the place is haunted, but that's just the start
the man who used to own it didn't have heart
just a nasty bunch of orange maggots filled with puss
he baked his wife into a pie and didn't leave a scrap of crust

you say you aren't nervous, but i know that's a lie
your hair is standing on it's end, i see it in your eyes
make sure you check under your bed and turn off all your lights
because you won't want to see what's standing by you in the night

welcome to the end of the world
isn't it the place to be seen
welcome to the end of the world
and have a happy halloween
