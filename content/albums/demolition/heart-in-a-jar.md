## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
She has my heart in a jar by her bedside, suspended in glittering gel.
It glows in the night when she can't get to sleep and silently wishes her well
It beats with a pace that isn't distracting, just barely without being still
So she can remember me, she can remember me when I am stranded in hell

She is my sister, my lover, my mother, my friend, courtesan, and foe
She helped to pay my dues and she is helping to build my throne
And she cannot die, and neither can I for I will continue to be
The heart in the jar in the glittering gel that glows when she can't get to sleep

Her hair is not fair, her skin is not fine, and her beauty might not be your taste
She is not the sweetest, nor is she richest, she is not the smallest of waist
She is an admiral, I am her soldier, fighting for stained glass refrains
So she can call for me, so she can call for me when she is lying in pain

She is my sister, my lover, my mother, my friend, courtesan, and foe
She helped to pay my dues and she is helping to build my throne
And she cannot die, and neither can I for I will continue to be
The heart in the jar in the glittering gel that glows when she can't get to sleep

Fierce and forgiving, she will keep living, after we've all gone away
Standing atop a tangle of iron, wind whipping her hair from her face
Soot stained and glamorous, oiled and armed to tackle all those who betray
And she'll have my heart in the jar on her bedside, wherever her bedside may be

She'll have my heart in a jar by her bedside, wherever her bedside may be.
