## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Romeo was young and he was unfraid
Juliet was dumb, easy to serenade
Little did they know the tragedy of fate
Star crossed lovers, happily dismayed

And I'm not one for suicide
At last not anymore
But you, my dear, are far too pretty
Not to fight a little for

Arise fair sun
And slay the envious moon
for she is sick and pale with grief
Goodbye, my love
For I have come too soon
And you'll not be with me

I guess it makes sense, the choice that you made
To pick Romeo who loved over the Romeo who was afraid
But that doesn't mean I didn't want to stay
I just have some priorities to get straight

And I'm I'm not one for poison
At least not anymore
But, girl, you're far too pretty
Not to die a little for

Arise fair sun
And slay the envious moon
for she is sick and pale with grief
Goodbye, my love
For I have gone too soon
And you'll not be with me

Romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I need you, I need you, now
Don't let go, don't let go, I can be your Romeo
I'll be Romeo some how

Arise fair sun
and slay slay slay the moon
For she is sick and pale, I'm so sick and pale with grief
My love,
For you have gone too soon
Why won't you be with me
With me
