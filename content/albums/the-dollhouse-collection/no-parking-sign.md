There is a no 
Parking sign I’m
Sitting by it late at night
Back in time when
You were mine this
Spot was cause for such delight
We would sit here in the dark
Kissing and turning off our phones
You’d skip around me
Down the street when
You got up to walk me home

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

She was there when
You were not I
Couldn’t help myself and I tried
To pretend it’s
Not my fault but
Always seem to catch my lies
No matter the circumstance
I have committed several sins
I’ve been like this with
Every man and
Just want to begin again

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum-da-dum

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

I’m sure I’ll be okay
