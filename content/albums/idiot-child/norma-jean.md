## Background
Lorem Ipsum

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
From a very young age I was Dolores Hayes
Assume suggestion from from away
And I played and I played and I played into the game

It wasn’t my fault, I was predisposed
To be presented and disposed
To be revered be revered be revered as a trophy

And I admit
I could have strived to be opposite
But I’m a girl and girls’ll be who they’ll be
So feel free
Feel free
Objectify me

It’s been a while since I have thought things through
And I have come to this conclusion
Just didn’t mind didn’t mind didn’t mind being used

And I admit
I could have strived to be opposite
But I’m a girl and girls’ll be who they’ll be
So feel free
Feel free
Objectify me

Norma Jean
She knows what I mean
It’s what they think when you look like me
So feel free
Feel free
Feel free

What am I what am I what am I
If I am not objectified
(x4)
