## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I am watching you
See ash dropped from your unlit cigarette
It must have been a lie
A little trick of the eye

Much like all the moves I think that you are making
Much like all the steps I think that you are taking
Much like my poor heart that you keep breaking

I am watching you
See life drip from the eyes of your victims
It must have been a joke
I stand and watch you choke

Much like all the words that slither from your red lips
Much like the seductive swinging of my full hips
Much like the look in your eyes with I slip and fall

Much like all the letters burning in the bonfire
That I never set so you would never know
The truth about the little girl behind the big lie
Where did my innocence go

I am watching you
I see pain in your step as you walk away
It must have been a dream
Nothing is at it seems

Much like all the tears falling from my green eyes
Much like all the fears I’m trying to leave behind
Much like how I say I’m not losing my mind
I’m not losing my mind
(x4)
