It's goin' down. Yo the girl got a gun,
Best run. Because she's quick to flip and empty out the clip,
And make a man understand where she's comin' from.
The hardcore's connected to the base of her fate.
She just breaks and bring drama to the situation,
Ejaculation of my projectile, she's buck wild.
Better recognize when she comes she comes correct.
Collects respect and if not, you catch a broken neck.
Buddy look down and your shirts all bloody,
Looks like she caught you with a bad one for messin with da mad one.
Told you bout this girl before, you didn't listen to me.
As I talk, now you're stalked by the hunter of the fronter,
Who's size five and sexy.
Quick, they catch your body and another one next week.
Huh it doesn't matter 'cause the girl stays strapped
She says she had enough of men and now she's lookin for payback.
And there's no way you can fade her son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
And there's no way that you can fade her son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
The most venomous feminist, homie, she ain't soft.
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off.
Or something that you like to think's the best:
She'll blow big holes in your chest.
She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies won't
She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies don't
She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies can't
She says she gotta 'cause she knows a lotta ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine.
Electrocute 'em light 'em up like Con Edison,
She got no fear five rings in their ear,
Holes in their nose, way-out clothes.
Living life to the fullest buck shot and bullets.
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she want to rule it.
Maybe she will 'cause she's quick to kill.
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites.
You never know where she'll come from.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
And there's no way that you can fade her son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
You got no time to trip or argue, you're through.
I'll bet she gets ya. Homeboy you'll catch a stretcher like so many before.
She's on a bodycount tour. But not rock, she's puttin sucker punks in cops.
You say she's nothin but a woman then you come up shot.
You say "Why you want to kill me?" and she says "why not?"
Pop she got a body that'll make you cry.
Pop she got a shotty that'll make you die.
Don't bring drama to her homie, 'cause you'll wind up flat.
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll peel your cap.
She got no lovin', love is something that she never had.
She loved her mother but she hate her motherfucking dad.
So stay the hell out her way, 'cause the girl don't play,
None!
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
So don't even try to play her, son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
So don't even try to front, son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
