{{< lyrics >}}
Maybe it's the way you look in your feathered cap
Or the fact that no one is sitting on your lap
It's been a rough day full of mud and mirth
My hair is frizzy and my feet really hurt
But you still look smooth out of your garb
Most guys around here don't get that far
You glance at me and you give me a wink
This is the kind of thing that makes me think

Oh!

It could be a ren faire romance
Love how you look in your tight pants
It could be a ren faire romance
Come on baby give me a chance
And maybe at the end of the day
I’ll let you unlace my corset but in a strictly nonsexual way
Because I want you to be the only thing that takes my breath away

I used to have a thing for Kyle the Slayer
But I heard that he was kind of a player
He got this disappointed look on his face
When I told him that I was of legal age
But you, you’re different, you’re pretty suave
I heard from Sarah that you have a real job
And you even gave me a leather rose
You have an iPhone full of Shakespearean prose

Oh!

It could be a ren faire romance
Love how you look in your tight pants
It could be a ren faire romance
Come on baby give me a chance
And maybe at the end of the day
I’ll let you unlace my corset but in a strictly nonsexual way
Because I want you to be the only thing that takes my breath away

Break down!

It’s so hard to find someone
Who understands the addiction
To buying beer you can’t afford
And following tudor traditions
Correct me if I’m wrong
But I think we could be
The next Queen Elizabeth and Sir Robert Dudley

It could be a ren faire romance
Love how you look in your tight pants
It could be a ren faire romance
It's not period to hold hands
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day
It wouldn’t get me in your pants anyway
Not that that’s all I want, but hey!
A girl can dream-eth
