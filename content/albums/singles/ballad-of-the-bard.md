## Background
There's been a demo version of this on Patreon for years now, and it's one of my favorite songs I've ever written. I think the lyrics speak for themselves; know I mean every single one and that I am singing directly to you. Thanks to the support of my audience over the years, I've been able to cultivate something of a life for myself. I can only hope the art I give you is payment enough for what you have given me; the freedom to be myself, as I am, no matter what that looks like.

If you need me, I'll be here a-singing and a-strumming.

This recording is from the season premiere of the fourth season of my musical variety show, the Lullaby Lounge; just me, a guitar, and a microphone. If you'd like to listen to the whole show as a podcast, you can find it here:

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I am not a doctor but I’ll do my best to heal you
listen to my voice and know your live another day
I may not be next to you but know that I can feel you
And I know what it’s like to live with pain
I’m not gonna lie to you your life may not be a dream come true but it won’t be like
This every day
No it won’t be like this every day

Tomorrow may be different but if it’s not you’ll survive
If I have to go through this shit, then you have to, too
I know sometimes it seems like the only option’s suicide
But you and I both know that isn’t true
I’m not gonna sugarcoat, sometimes the only way is hope
So then hope is what we have to do
I guess hope will have to do

And when hopes big sister faith comes knocking at your door
Don’t pretend that you’ve never met before
You have to remember it won’t be like this forever
don’t have to make the same mistakes
I’ll help you find the better place

You may be in darkness but I swear a light is coming
Grab it by the neck and drag it if you must
If you need, I’ll be here, a-singing and a-strumming
And I’ve got your back no matter what
We’ve got family and friends who can change our story’s end
Though it may not ever go away
We know it’s not like this every day
