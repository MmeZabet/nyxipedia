## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I know of a place, well, it isn't a place,
It's a time in space that you're welcome to grace
No need for refinement, just come as you are
It doesn't take much to become a lodestar!

You'll laugh and you'll cry, just give it a try,
I want to say more but it's a surprise
If you feel lost and you want to be found
Just come on down to the Lullaby Lounge!

There's new friends to meet
There's foes to defeat
There's songs and there's stories and more

The folly and fun have already begun,
so let's get this show started- 1! 2! 3! 4!

The coziest concert in cyberspace
The Lullaby Lounge can be any place
Each Tuesday at 8 this nightclub appears

Wherever you are, I'm so glad that you're here
