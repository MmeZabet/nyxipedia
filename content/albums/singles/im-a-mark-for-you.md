## Background
A wrestling themed love song for my husband, who recently retired from performing as a luchador. It started out as a joke, but turned out very much not like a joke. What can you do?

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I knew when I saw you
It was in your eyes
A fire I’d forgotten
Suddenly alight

You keep your distance
Maybe I’m missing
Some sort of sign

But if I listen
You just convince me
I want a take the dive

cause I’m a mark for you
it’s isn’t smart
I’m such a mark
cut out my heart for you
it isn’t smart
i shouldn’t start
I’m such a mark

I laugh at every joke you’re telling
Every move you make, I’m selling
when we kiss, it’s overwhelming
Someone help me

you just dismiss me
because you miss me
yeah I can see it now
I might be needy
but don’t deceive me
Or I will take you down

cause I’m a mark for you
it’s isn’t smart
I’m such a mark
cut out my heart for you
it isn’t smart
i shouldn’t start
I’m such a mark

I succumb to your charade
Whatever you want, you can take
I’m learning to love your mistakes
so you can cut the kayfabe

You keep your distance
Maybe I’m missing
some sort of sign
but when you kiss me
you just convince me
that I am still alive
