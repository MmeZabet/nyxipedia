## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
My name is Winslow and I'm a bean
And every day, I got to scream
I need more dry food, I need more wet
Give me spinach, now, GIVE ME PETS

Oh
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Bean Gotta
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}

*facemelting piano solo*

Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
Bean Gotta Bean Gotta
Bean Gotta Scream {MEOW MEOW MEOW}
