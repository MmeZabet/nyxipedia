## Background
Last year, my good friend Jeff Stormer set out with my husband and I to create our very own Generic Winter Holiday Special. Not only did we succeed, we had a great time, and you can now listen to it in podcast form here: anchor.fm/wrestling-nerds-radio-net/support

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
it’s that special time
so merry and bright
children laugh and play
on generic winter holiday

I’ll tell you the truth, it’s been a hell of a year
and I don’t know about you, but I could sure use some cheer
Since we can’t gather with our family and friends
Why don’t we take a magical journey instead?

I know what you’re thinking, “but, Jeff, I’m at home
I can’t just go adventuring all out on my own”
Well, listen up, lodestars, and open your eyes
If you’re willing to wonder, then I’ll be your guide

We start with Kate Nyx, the hostess of this show,
She’s doing her best, but her spirits are low
If you’ll help me out, then, my plan’s underway
Let’s show her the meaning of Generic Winter Holiday

Generic Winter Holiday
Where everyone is equal, however big or small-iday
The choices you make matter most off all today
That’s what makes the magic of Generic Winter Holiday
