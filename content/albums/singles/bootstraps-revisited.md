## Background
After much consideration, deliberation, and consternation, I have decided to begin work on a new album. I will be producing it entirely by myself over the winter; the only reason I'm even saying anything is to hold myself accountable.

I've learned a lot since the creation of my last record, about where my limits lie, and how to navigate them. I've also learned a lot about producing music over the past few years and am at a point where I think I can make something worthy of releasing on my own.

I plan to re-record some singles and demos I've released already, as well as several new songs. My hope is to release it in the spring of 2021; I plan to show the process behind the scenes and share any fruits of my labor on my Patreon at www.katenyx.com/join If you're there already you will most likely recognize many of the songs I plan to record.

In the meantime, enjoy this fresh take on my 2018 single, Bet it On The Bootstraps. I hope I can come through for myself, and you.

welcome to the rat race racetrack honey
where you gonna put that put that money
you look like you could use some help
maybe you should learn to help yourself

you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine

but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine
but i say bet in on the bootstraps

bad luck never looked so good
prettiest pauper in the neighborhood
man down, stand down, please, god, take the pain
turns out god doesnâ€™t take medicaid

you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine

but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on DBT
on diet, prayer, and therapy
but i say bet in on the bootstraps

have faith in yourself
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
and trust no one else
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
have faith in yourself
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
and trust no one
and trust no one else

bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on DBT
on diet, prayer, and therapy
but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
