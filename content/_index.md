# Nyxipedia

{{< columns >}}
Welcome to Nyxipedia.

In theory, someday, this could maybe be a useful and informative site about [Kate Nyx](https://katenyx.com) and her [work](https://katenyx.bandcamp.com).  Right now, it's still pretty early on.  We've got pages for (hopefully) all released songs from her Bandcamp, with lyrics for most!  If you'd like to help fix up the missing ones, or ones marked as needing help, please feel free to open a pull request, or if you're not comfortable with that you can always open an issue on the linked repo and provide your suggestions!
