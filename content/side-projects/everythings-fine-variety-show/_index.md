# The Everything's Fine Happy Sunshine Variety Show

During a brief run in 2016 and 2017, Kate performed a live show called The Everything's Fine Happy Sunshine Variety Show with Paul and Sway.  During this point in her career, she was going by the stage name Sway Bradbury ("the hottest dumpster fire in South Philadelphia").  This show was performed at the Raven Lounge, and contained many elements which would eventually be seen on The Lullaby Lounge, including the first appearance of the original version of Dex.  Only three shows are known to have been performed for sure, and footage of two of them has been found and are linked here.
