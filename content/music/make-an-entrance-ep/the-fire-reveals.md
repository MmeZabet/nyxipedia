## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I used to feel down; hit the ground running
Makes me feel alive
I looked for the answer until I changed the question:
I pull back the curtain
I pull back the curtain

I used to feel down; hit the ground running
Makes me feel alive
Assess what passion emits and press pass the limits
I pull back the curtain
