## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
you thought i would never learn to open up my cage
you were so much more concerned with throwing your parade
when you took your victory lap the war had just begun
while i made my strategies, you had assumed you’d won

so bow down
bow down before your queen
get on your knees
kneel and worship me
bow down

to say that i am made of stars is insult to the earth
i am metal blood and thorn and i know what i’m worth
i don’t need a cavalry to tear your castle down
And I will feel no guilt when I have burnt it to the ground

so bow down
bow down before your queen
get on your knees
kneel and worship me

you can’t reap what I have sown
i have come for what i’m owed
i won’t be bought, i can’t be owned
bow down before your queen
you don’t seem to understand
this is all part of my plan
i am no mere mortal man
so get down on your knees
and bow down

bow down

bow down before your queen
get on your knees
kneel and worship me
you can’t reap what I have sown
i have come for what i’m owed
i won’t be bought, i can’t be owned
bow down before your queen
I am not my father’s son
You will pay for what you’ve done
I slayed the moon, arise fair sun,
now get down on your knees
and bow down
