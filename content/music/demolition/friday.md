This is the city of Los Angeles, California
One of the largest in the United States
Spreads out in all four directions
Like a broad loom rug
All types of people coming and going
It's pretty much like your town
I work here, I carry a badge

Gannon's in the front seat
Backstrand in the back seat
It's a hot shot, we'd better get going

It's Friday, Friday
Crime's down cause of Friday
Everyone is workin' on the weekend, weekend
Friday, Friday
Solvin' crime with Friday
There's an APB out so we're workin' all weekend
Romero, Romero
Romero, Romero
Frank, Frank, Frank
Lookin' forward to lunch with Gannon

1K80 cruisin down the highway
Rollin' code 3, gotta catch this guy
Frank, Frank, thinkin' of Frank
You know who he is
We got this, we got this
Gonna solve this crime
We got this, we got this
KMA367

Gannon's in the front seat
Backstrand in the back seat
It's a hot shot, we'd better get going

Joe Friday, Friday
Crime's down cause of Friday
Everyone is workin' all weekend, weekend
Friday, Friday
Solvin' crime with Friday
There's an APB out so we're workin' all weekend
Romero, Romero
Romero, Romero
Frank, Frank, Frank
Lookin' forward to lunch with Gannon

Yesterday was juvenile, juvenile
Today is narcotics, -cotics
What what what's it all about
What's it all about
It's a routine investigation
Tomorrow is robbery and bunco is afterwards
I don't want this Dragnet to end

Ben chillin' in the front seat
In the back seat
We're drivin', cruisin'
Fast lanes, switchin' lanes
With a red light on the side
Backstrand givin' orders behind me
Make the big September man's worst dream
Check my time, I'm Friday, it's a weekend
We gonna work all night, come on y'all

It's Friday, Friday
Crime's down cause of Friday
Everyone is workin' on the weekend, weekend
Friday, Friday
Solvin' crime with Friday
There's an APB out so we're workin' all weekend
Romero, Romero
Romero, Romero
Frank, Frank, Frank
Lookin' forward to lunch with Gannon
