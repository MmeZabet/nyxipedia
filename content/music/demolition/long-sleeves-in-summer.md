{{< lyrics >}}
The movies are lying, it isn't romantic
A constant exchange between painful and panic
The bathroom is chapel, this bath is your service
While every mistake you made floats to the surface
Reconciliation burns white on your conscience
How long can this go on while you are still conscious
You're lost, but you're willing, it's hard but you're trying
I promise the dawn is much better than dying

And you won't spend your life
Wearing long sleeves in summer
You won't spend your nights trying to forget who you are
You are not your scar
So take a deep breath
Try to stay in the moment
Tomorrow is scary but right now it's just you and me
One day you'll be free
I believe

I'll tell you the truth, that perfection is pointless
If we all looked the same wouldn't looking be joyless?
All skin really does is cover your organs
So color yourself with what you deem important
Reconciliation burns black on your record
But I swear to god, I will help you get better
You're lost, but you're looking, it's hard but you need them
Any step you take is a step towards freedom

And you won't spend your life
Wearing long sleeves in summer
You won't spend your nights trying to forget who you are
You are not your scar
So take a deep breath
Try to stay in the moment
Tomorrow is scary but right now it's just you and me
One day you'll be free
I believe

The movies are lying, it isn't romantic
A constant exchange between painful and panic
The bathroom is chapel, this bath is your service
While every mistake you made floats to the surface
