## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Romeo was young, and he was unafraid
Juliet was dumb, easy to serenade
Little did they know the tragedy of fate
Star-crossed lovers happily dismayed

I’m not one for suicide, at least not anymore
But girl you’re just too pretty not to die a little for

Arise, fair sun, and slay the envious moon
She is sick and pale with grief
Goodbye, my love, for I have come too soon
You will not be with me, with me

I guess it makes sense, the choice that you made
To pick Romeo who loved, over Romeo who was afraid
But that doesn’t mean I didn’t want to stay
I just have some priorities to get straight

I’m not one for poison, at least not anymore
But girl you’re far too pretty not to kill a little for

Arise, fair sun, and slay the envious moon
She is sick and pale with grief
Goodbye, my love, for I have come too soon
You will not be with me, with me

Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
I need you, I need you now
Don’t let go, don’t let go, I can be your Romeo
I’ll be Romeo somehow

Arise, fair sun, and slay slay slay the moon
She is sick and pale, I’m so sick and pale
With grief, my love, for you have gone too soon
Why won’t you be with me, with me?
With me
