DEMOlition is an ongoing pseudo-album of demo versions of songs Kate has recorded.

From Kate:

A collection of alternate live takes and demos, updated occasionally as I record new things and want to test them out. Enjoy!

Bonus materials if you download, including an interview with me that appeared on BBC radio!
