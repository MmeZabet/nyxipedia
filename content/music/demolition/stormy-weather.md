## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
(spoken)
I'm gonna sing this, then.
I'm gonna sing this, then!

(sung)
Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Can't get my poor heart together
Just keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Can't get my poor self together
Just keeps raining all the time

When you went away
The blues walked in and met me
If you stay away
Old rockin' chair gon' get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Every thing I have is gone
Stormy weather
Can't get my poor life together
Just keeps raining all the time
(x3)
