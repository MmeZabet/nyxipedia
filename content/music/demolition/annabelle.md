## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Annabelle sat
Next to the train tracks
The sunset stared back
As she swung her feet

Against the guard rail
Her hair in pigtails
Every tall tale
She told was in her teeth

Her mother said that fibbers were the devils kin & kind
And that she wouldn’t get anywhere by telling all those lies
But Annabelle was happier playing in her mind
So she lied
Oh, she lied.

Annabelle sat
Next to the train tracks
The sky was so black
You couldn’t see the stars

Against the stop lights
The neon bar signs
She knew it was time
To find a new front yard

She packed her journals & her comb, her necklace made of shells
And her mother told her she was going straight to hell
But the devils playground was better than standing still
Hey Annabelle
Oh, Annabelle

Annabelle sat
Next to the train tracks
And she looked back
But she felt no fear

She said a prayer
Home was nowhere
Home was somewhere
But it wasn’t here
