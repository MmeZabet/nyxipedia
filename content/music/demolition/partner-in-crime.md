those who say that love is blind
must have never met me
i set you in my sights
I decided we were meant to be
but i didn’t plan for this
how much it would all come true
who’d have known that at the end of my rainbow was you

you’re not exactly perfect, but neither am i
do you think that it’s worth it to have me by your side

i’ll make an exception to the rule
you are such a fool
you think you’re kind when you are cruel
you don’t know what to say
but you are where i go when I am scared
you’re still standing there
even though you’re unprepared
for this juggling act called life
you’re my partner in crime

those who say it ends in time
must have never met me
i kick my horses long past death
I love my lovers when they leave
but as much as we have done
here we are still having fun
who’d have known that after all this time it’s you who were the one?

you’re not exactly perfect, but god knows I’m not either
if I didn’t believe in love, you would have made me a believer

i’ll make an exception to the rule
you are such a fool
you think you’re kind when you are cruel
you don’t know what to say
but you are where i go when I am scared
you’re still standing there
even though you’re unprepared
for this juggling act called life
you’re my partner in crime

I’m pretty good at guessing, but I don’t know what comes next
we’re not exactly perfect, but we’re doing our best

i’ll make an exception to the rule
god, i’m such a fool
I think I’m kind when I am cruel
I have too much to say
and I know that I have made you scared
you’re still standing there
can’t you see I’m unprepared
for this juggling act called life
you’re my partner in crime
