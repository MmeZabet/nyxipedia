{{< lyrics >}}
God I wish that I could sell out
Fully endorsed
I'm off my high horse
I just wanna make some money
Why can't somebody see?
I'd be the perfect face
For their brand of deception, no hidden intentions
I'm tired of being poor
Baby I'm off my high horse
I'm off my high horse

God I wish that I could sell out
All expenses paid for a simple serenade
I just wanna live happy
Somebody slap me with a contract and a car
A million dollar deal or at least a few meals
I'm just tired of being poor
Baby I'm off my high horse
I'm off my high horse

And I'm not being facetious dear friend
I'd be a pretty business expense
Just a couple lines of law and a pen
I'm yours until the fiscal year ends

God I wish that I could sell out
A radio spot or two
It's all I'd have to do to pay the doctor what I owe
And my rent and my phone
Just enough to live
I might not be perfect but I think I deserve this
I'm tired of being poor
Baby I'm off my high horse
I'm off my high horse
I can't find my high horse
I'm off my high horse
