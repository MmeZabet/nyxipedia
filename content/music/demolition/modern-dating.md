So, this I'm bout to play for you is, um, a song I wrote.  Is a song I wrote...  was after I was dating the snake, so let me think.  Was probably eight years ago now, maybe maybe seven year ago now, that I wrote this song.  Um.  This song is inspired by an article I read about dating in 2014 or 2012 or whenever it was.  It is like, "Twenty things that are bad about dating in the modern times," and I was like "You know what would help all of you in these problems is this song."

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
It's not dating, it's just hanging out
It's just like dating, except it's filled with doubt
If you sleep with your ex one drunken night
You're not dating, so everything's alright
And you can feel bad, but don't you dare say sorry
Saying sorry means you might care about someone besides yourself

And god forbid you tell someone you like them
God forbid you speak without a smirk
Because if you tell someone that you like them
They might know you're not a total jerk

She's not your girlfriend, you're simply just talking
Which is like being your girlfriend, except you send her walking home
After you fuck her almost every other night
Cause if you sleep next to one another then it might ruin
The delicate balance of nonchalance and sarcasm
That makes up the fundamental makeup of your entire facade

And god forbid you tell someone you like them
God forbid you might say something nice
Because if you tell someone that you like them
They can tell your heart's not made of ice

So keep those feelings locked up tight
If you keep up your walls then no one can hurt you
I hate to ruin your night
If you keep everyone at a distance
Then they're bound to desert you

So grow a pair and tell someone you love them
If they don't reciprocate it's fine
Rejection is a part of being human
And every wound you have can heal with time
Yes, every wound you have can heal with time
