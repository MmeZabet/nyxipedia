## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
i am no saint i have my sins
i let who i thought i was win
i've lost my soul to nonchalance
i cannot tell what pain i've caused
my body's here. my heart is not
the war i waged was hardly fought
and at what cost, where do i go
i pray to gods i barely know

with wine and fire
with blood and bone
i drink, i burn, i bleed alone
god help me now,
i've lost my way
and so i bend my knees and pray

I can't say what I sacrificed
so that my ego could survive
i could not have been left less whole
i cut apart my heart and soul
on every stage i left a piece
to acquiesce my devotees
i gave away all i could see
and now there's nothing left for me

with wine and fire
with blood and bone
i drink, i burn, i bleed alone
god help me now,
i've lost my way
and so i bend my knees and pray

forgive me, saints, for i have sinned
i let my lesser morals win
I gave away all that I could
and now I might be done for good
No spotlight to reveal my path
No audience to stand and clap
I pray to god but don't believe
i drink, i burn, i swear i bleed



with wine and fire, with blood and bone
the lights are off, the curtain's closed
So lock the door and toss the key
My secrets are what set me free
