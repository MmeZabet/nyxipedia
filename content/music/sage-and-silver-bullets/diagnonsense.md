## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
It was predicted by my mother's eyes
With tears that wandered down her face
That my psyche would be volatile
With several parts misplaced
The section meant for direction
Never developed fully
Now ribbons tied to my cortexes
Find new places to pull me

I say I'm not losing my mind
Because it's running free
It's travelled long and loathesome hours
To get away from me

It sits in an unsealed mason jar
Upon some official's desk
Happy in it's unhappiness
And finally at rest
And here I sit, without a conscience
But i have never been at peace
Not technically conscious
But cognitive at least

I say I'm not losing my mind
Because it took a train
Through North Carolina and New Orleans
To find itself new names

This addiction that I have is not to any substance
No nicotine can sway me, no alcohol can numb it
I don't adore heroin, I don't fancy cocaine
I'm in love to my very core with causing myself pain

I say I'm not losing my mind
But we know that's a lie
It travelled long and loathsome hours
To find somewhere to die
Like a cat curled in a corner
Underneath the basement stairs
To breath its final breath alone
So you don't have to care.
Peaceful in its death alone
With no one left to care.
