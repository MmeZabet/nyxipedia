## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
i'll be fine without you
find tomorrow on my own
not everything's about you
and you can't know what's comin down the road
what the future holds

i'm gonna get better
can't rain till the end of time
there's changes in the weather
only god knows what is down the line
and darlin, it's alright

you can tell me that i'm crazy
but i can tell you're lying

you say that i'm nothing
but i'm fire, and you're the fuel
you say no one can love me
but i think you forgot the golden rule
so keep on bein' cruel

tell me i'm a disaster
but at least i'm not a fool

storms may gather but i'll harvest the thunder
weave with lightning to make things of wonder
i'll bleed my ink from blackened skies
and write my poems on telephone lines
You don't get to run my life
I'm not your mother, child or wife
Who are you to say I'm lost
I've found myself amidst the fog

i won't let you destroy me
you cannot take my soul
your spell may still be on me
but some day soon i will be in control
i don't have far to go

the tunnel's getting shorter
and time is tickin' on
the light is getting brighter
i know that it can't be very long
until the night is gone

you can say it's getting darker
but i know you're wrong
