{{< lyrics >}}
i can feel it creeping up behind me
i can feel its breath upon my ear
i can feel its skeletal hands guide me
out of the corner of my eye, i can see it drawing near

i can hear it slink among the shadows
i can hear its laughter on the wind
i know its preparing for the gallows
I know that its craving to hang me for my sins

but i will still fight for my redemption
god as my witness, i will make a stand
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
and I just want to be a better man

i can see it counting all my errors
I can see it clouding up my eyes
The nights are long and dark and filled with terror
It knows my faults, it knows me fears and lies

I can tell that it knows that I am trying
It watches my attempts and cocks its head
It doesn't know that I am slowly dying
Because it thinks I am already dead

but i will still fight for my redemption
I'm doing what I can, but can't you see
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
but honestly, I just want to sleep

i am nothing but collective malice
piled up in books besides my head
it is the rabbit and i am always alice
fighting all the monsters in my head

try as i might to fight for my redemption
i do my best, but what's done is done
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
and like all the times before, the devil won
