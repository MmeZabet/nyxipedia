## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
put a bullet in the head
of every wretched word you said
tried to pretend that you don't exist
but pretending didn't work
tried to fill your mouth with dirt
but it all just passed right through your lips

get back in your grave
you can't haunt me forever
get back in your grave
get back in your grave
i'm trying to get better
get back in your grave

in the dark, there's always ghosts
you play my ribs like xylophones
reminding me i wasn't worth a dime
you bled me of my innocence
you claimed it was just ignorance
and that i should thank you for your time

i put a bullet in the head
of every pretty word you said
i thought killing them would work
but they still bubble from the earth
their hands claw through the grass
they whisper when I pass
that it's something to behold
how i'm nothing and you're gold

get back in your grave
i hurt but i keep living
get back in your grave
get back in your grave
you shall never be forgiven
get back in your grave
