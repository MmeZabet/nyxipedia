{{< lyrics >}}
baby, calm down,
baby, calm down,
it's gonna be fine
baby, calm down
baby, calm down,
one day you'll be mine

i can't wash you off of my skin
look at all the trouble i'm in
i can't get you out of my head
never kicked you out of my bed
you said

baby, calm down,
baby, calm down,
it's gonna be fine
baby, calm down
baby, calm down,
one day you'll be mine

in time

your disaster burrowed in me
and developed into disease
i still see your face in my dreams
three years passed and i'm still unclean
you breathed

baby, calm down,
baby, calm down,
it's gonna be fine
baby, calm down
baby, calm down,
one day you'll be mine

in time
