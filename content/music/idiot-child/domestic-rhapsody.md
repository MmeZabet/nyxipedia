(vocalizing)
I can tell from the way you smile
That you think I’m inferior
[[unclear]] I complain because 
I’m used to you being superior

She’s a goddess in a blue dress
I’m a teenage fantasy
This little thing you can control
With your domestic rhapsody

Aren’t you such a catch
Would you like to dance
We’re a new perfect match
A pretty second chance

I can tell from your lack of words
That you miss her immeasurably
For when you were by her side
The same silence made for me

And you said not to count my failures
Before they commence
I’m in love with someone’s lover
And she makes more sense

Aren’t you such a catch
Would you like to dance
We’re a new perfect match
A pretty second chance

Choose her, please choose her
You can let me go
I’d rather be lonely than really never know
Choose her, please choose her
I know she makes you sing
Baby this will work when I’m your everything
(bum bum bum)

But you’re such a catch
Would you like to dance
We’re a new perfect match
A pretty second chance
