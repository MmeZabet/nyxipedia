## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Romeo was young
But he was unafraid
Juliet was dumb
Easy to serenade
Little do they know
The tragedy of fate
Star-crossed lovers happily dismayed

I’m not one for suicide
At least not anymore
But girl you’re far too pretty not to die a little for
Arise fair sun and slay the envious moon
For she is sick and pale
With grief
Good bye my love, for I have come too soon
You’ll not be with me with me

I guess it makes sense
The choice that you made to pick
Romeo in love
Over Romeo who was afraid
But that doesn’t mean
I didn’t want to stay
I just had some priorities to get straight

I’m not one for poison
At least not any more
But girl you’re far too pretty not to kill a little for
Arise fair sun and slay the envious moon
For she is sick and pale with grief
Good bye my love, for I have come too soon,
You’ll not be with me with me

Romeo Romeo
Wherefore art thou Romeo
I need you I need you now
Don’t let go, don’t let go
I could be your Romeo
I’ll be Romeo somehow

Arise fair sun and slay slay slay
The moon, for she is sick and pale
I’m so sick and pale
With grief, good
Bye my love, for you have gone too soon
Why won’t you be with me with me
With me
