# Norma Jean

## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="S01E20113" >}}
I'm gonna sing you something depressing about my history with, um, sex work.  And being a child.  It's about my history of sex work <b>and</b> my history as a child.  You can <b>imagine</b> what the subject matter is going to be.  Okay, so, let's...  Let's start from the beginning.  Here's how I used to introduce this song, when I was playing it on a regular basis at house shows, and concerts, and events.  This is how this song would be introduced.
<br />
...
<br />
Imagine...  In, like, ten years, that I'm Lady Gaga famous.  I want you to imagine a world where Kate Nyx's name is on everyone's lips.  Everyone!  Everyone is pumped for Kate Nyx.  I'm like-- I am, I am beyond Katy Perry.  I am Lady Gaga/Madonna level famous.  So, it's a big night.  I am about to host a <b>huge</b> concert in Philadelphia.  And there's a big, red velvet curtain.  And a single spotlight, and a vintage microphone on the stage.  And I come out in my super sparkly dress.  I have, like, a sequined, sparkly dress.  And I walk out with my guitar, and I walk up to the microphone.  Put on my guitar.  I walk up to the microphone.  Single spotlight shining on me, everything else is dark.  You can see the lights reflecting off of my dress, it's like a disco ball.  I walk up to the mic, and I say, "Who here's been molested!?"

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
From a very young age I was Dolores Haze
Assume suggestion from from away
And I played and I played and I played into the game

It wasn’t my fault, I was predisposed
To be presented and disposed
To be revered be revered be revered as a trophy

And I admit
I could have strived to be opposite
But I’m a girl and girls’ll be who they’ll be
So feel free
Feel free
Objectify me

It’s been a while since I have thought things through
And I have come to this conclusion
Just didn’t mind didn’t mind didn’t mind being used

And I admit
I could have strived to be opposite
But I’m a girl and girls’ll be who they’ll be
So feel free
Feel free
Objectify me

Norma Jean
She knows what I mean
It’s what they think when you look like me
So feel free
Feel free
Feel free

What am I what am I what am I
If I am not objectified
(x4)
