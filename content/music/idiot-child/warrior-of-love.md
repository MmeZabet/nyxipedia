{{< lyrics >}}
Tell me I don’t have to worry
That if you strap on your holsters and go
Into a fray you found in fury
But continued through your need to know

Defining lines as you cross them
Leads to misleading mistakes
Don't live your life like you've lost him
Regret none of the choices you make

You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you really making you stronger
Warrior of love
You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns,
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you really makes you stronger
Warrior of love

And the scars you have from battle
Stain your eyes and slur your speech
Tears that you have shed for shackles
So you could have him in your reach

You find the symptoms as you stop them
Your path is delicate and true
Don't live your life like you've lost him
Cause he's who is losing you

You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you really making you stronger
Warrior of love
You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns,
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you really makes you stronger
Warrior of love

Your company is strong
I'm your soldier in song
You are in the right
But there is no wrong
What you want can be real
Don't fear what you feel
You're fighting for a good cause

You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you really makes you stronger
Warrior of love
You're a warrior of love, stick to your guns,
There will be a time when you fight no longer
What's wounding you is really making you stronger
Warrior of love
You’re a warrior of love
Warrior of love
