## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
[[unintelligible]] and cheap motels and call a highway home
After midnight coffee dates wherever we may roam
Just another place that we don’t have to be alone

We don’t need a street address, nowhere we belong
You and me in 83, really can’t go wrong
I can show you Spoutwood and sing you silly songs

We can be whoever we want in the morning
But tonight let’s just be lovers
No need for false identities
Let’s just stay under covers

We’ll leave a trail of cigarettes and glitter for them to find
They don’t know our faces yet, but they will in time
The [[everson?]] looks lovely with you on the other side

We won’t be fools and tell ourselves the other is the one
I might change my hair, you might sharpen your tongue
This is gonna be a lot more than fun

We can be whoever we want in the morning
But tonight let’s just be lovers
No need for false identities
Let’s just stay under covers

You and me under covers
