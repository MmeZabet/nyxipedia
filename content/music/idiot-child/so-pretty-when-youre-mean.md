## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
It’s been said that I’m
Wasting all of my time
Counting on my hands and feet 
Every loving word you said to me

I might be able to get
Some other man to ease my frets 
I would rather be your step stool 
Than some other man’s collie

You’re too beautiful for pictures
Too beautiful for me
With your lily white complexion 
And your vibrant eyes of green
Too beautiful for sorrow
Pitty’s not really your scene
Mercy’s never been your color
So pretty when you’re mean
So pretty when you’re mean

The expression on your face
Says you wanna state your case
That I’m testing all my limits
And you’re taking all the blame

You might not be the bad guy
But turns out neither am I
Destroying one another
Bombing our hearts into flame

You’re too beautiful for pictures
Too beautiful for me
With your lily white complexion 
And your apparent eyes of green
Mercy’s never been your color
So pretty when you’re mean
So pretty when you’re mean

I had to take the time to say
That I am happy with our ways
And I hope you feel the same
Seeing me
At the end of the day

And I love you with
All my heart and
Several other
Body parts
And when I stop you always stop but
You still have my heart to break

You’re too beautiful for pictures
Too beautiful for me
With your lily white complexion
And your apparent eyes of green
Mercy’s never been your color
So pretty when you’re mean
So pretty when you’re mean
So pretty when you’re mean
So pretty when you’re mean

So pretty
When you’re
Mean.
