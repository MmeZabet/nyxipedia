## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
You’re tall, you’re funny, and you’re smart
You like the way that I make art
And when you look at me
I feel my veins buzz like bumblebees
There’s really something about you
That makes me blush and makes me swoon
Even when I’m annoyed
You’re leagues beyond the other boys

This may be another cutesy song on ukulele
But I mean it
And I might be singing this all wrong on ukulele
But I mean it
Oh I mean it

The same things always get said
About the stuff inside my head
My songs are rife with misery
So what does that say about me
Here it is a song for you
That isn’t full of doom and gloom
It’s like a picnic in the park
Which sounds like a pretty nice idea right now

This may be another cutesy song on ukulele
But I mean it
And I might be singing this all wrong on ukulele
But I mean it
Oh I mean it

I mean it when I said that you hurt me
But I would rather be in love today
I’ll smile when you kiss my tears away
So even though
I’m a little bit confused
Even then I mean it when I say
I love
Ukulele
