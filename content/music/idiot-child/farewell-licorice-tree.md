## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Long hair, long beads
Big eyes, big feet
I was just like you
You were just like me
We matched each other to a T
We tried so hard to be
The other ace in a perfect pair
Changed my penmanship
You dyed your hair
Made jokes
Made friends
Made people stare
They laughed at us
But we didn’t care

If I could go back in time
I would cross the same lines
Didn’t matter if we were wrong or right
You were mine

And now I look at photos of you
Doing all the things I want to do
I tried to find out what went wrong
Was I destined for nothing
All along

You are an art school debutant
You’re getting everything you want
It was never a race between you and i
But I feel so far behind

If I could go back in time
I would cross the same lines
It didn’t matter if we were wrong or right
You were mine
You were
Mine

We are so different than we were
I’m a drop out
And you
You’re a college girl
Our dreams have separated so
I think it’s time for me to let go
(x3)
