Dear dear boy
What have I done
All I wanted was a friend
I found myself in love
Dear dear boy
Just as lost as you
It’s getting pretty dark out here
I come inside your room

Hold me
Scold me
Just let me be near
Uncover me
Discover me
Just don’t let them here

Dear dear boy
I must have crossed the line
Because my hand is in your hand
There’s fire in your eyes
Dear dear boy
I can’t open my heart
If I move another inch 
I’ll fall into your arms

Hold me 
Scold me 
Just let me be near
Uncover me
Discover me
Just don’t let them hear

Dear dear boy
Doing what I must
Because someday I’ll dance away
And leave this in the dust
Dear dear boy 
With every breath I take
Reminded of your crooked smile
The beautiful mistake 
You’re such a beautiful mistake
(x2)
