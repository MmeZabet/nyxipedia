## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Do you wanna be my patron?
Go check out my Patreon
I do my best to fill it up
With lots of stuff that I work hard on
I am a starving artist and the cost is less
Than the change left in your couch
Do you wanna be a patron?
You don't have to stay a patron...
Just try it out!

Do you wanna be my patron?
Spend a dollar, maybe five
What have you really got to lose
Don't mean to schmooze, just trying to survive
I think I'm getting heartburn
My bank account, just watching the dollars whiz by

I don't mean to sound ungrateful
I work hard and pay my dues
I know what I'm really asking for
Is so much more than just some buckaroos
If this wasn't important
I wouldn't try
But I'm doing my best
Do you wanna be my patron?
You don't have to be my patron...
Please say yes
