So, recently, Tumblr, um, mentioned that maybe someone who dated Taylor Swift should sing a song called Maybe You're the Problem.  So this song goes out to Taylor, and Adele, and every other female artist on the radio who won't do anything but write breakup songs.  And every other female artist on the radio who won't do anything, er, that isn't on the radio that won't do anything but write breakup songs.  Like myself.  I have written far too many breakup songs, and I am ready to break the habit.  So I wrote this song, called Maybe You're the Problem.  And, um, yeah, I'm gonna play it for you.  It's on ukulele right now, but I don't think it's gonna end up being on ukulele.  I don't know.  I just used ukulele to write it.  So.  It's just a little out of my range too, I might have to retune this.  But I just wanted to let you know, this is happening.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
You've dated one too many assholes
You keep saying all men are the same
Been cheated on by every single boyfriend
Running around, trying to find someone else to blame
You say you couldn't imagine any outcome
Could ever possibly be this way
You wear your heart on your Facebook
It's no wonder it's so easy to break

But, little girl, I've got something to say

Honey, maybe you're the problem
Maybe you're the issue
Maybe if you didn't just press repeat
You'd wind up needing fewer tissues
You're the wrong girl
You can't just solve men
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem

You've dated one too many douchebags
God, you sure know how to pick your poison
Maybe if you paid attention to where you're going
You would learn to make better choices
You say you can't predict the future
You don't have a crystal ball
Can't imagine spending my life
With such a fucking know-it-all
If you walk around with wool over your eyes
You're bound to trip and fall

Honey, maybe you're the problem
Maybe you're the issue
Maybe if you didn't just press repeat
You'd wind up needing fewer tissues
You're the wrong girl
You can't just solve men
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem

I've been there
I've made mistakes
I've fallen in love
With people I hate
Pretentious dicks
That stand me up
But here's to having better luck

Oh honey

Maybe you're the problem
Maybe you're the issue
Maybe if you didn't just press repeat
You'd wind up needing fewer tissues
You're the wrong girl
You can't just solve men
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem
Honey, it's a hard world, hard world, hard world
Maybe you're the problem
