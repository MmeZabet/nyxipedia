## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Pardon me darling, but I must be blunt
I'd rather see you dead than see you with some stupid cunt
Pardon me darling, I have to be sure
Was it you, the prince of transients who called me insecure?

Look at you you pretty clockwork orange
Tick tock, tick tocking for some unknown cause
You're such a pretty clockwork orange
Only performing for the round of applause

And I know, I know
It's only so long until I tumble to the valley below
I'm aware that this Jill won't tumble after
Because Jack is way too fucking scared to fall

Pardon me darling, but you must be blind
There's no way in hell I'm as petty as you seem to find
Pardon me darling, I've known all along
You're only as good as the little things that you did wrong

Look at you you pretty clockwork orange
Tick tock, tick tocking your way to our hearts
Look, you're such a pretty clockwork orange
If only you trusted us enough not to pick us apart

I know, I know
It's only so long until I tumble to the valley below
I'm aware that this Jill won't tumble after
Because Jack is way too fucking scared to fall

Memories come back in flashes
Dancing cities down to ashes
But the game's no longer fun
'Cause you my love are not the one

And I know, I know
It's only so long until I tumble to the valley below
I'm aware that this Jill won't tumble after
Because Jack is way too fucking scared to fall

Jack is way too fucking scared to fall
Jack is way too fucking scared to fall
