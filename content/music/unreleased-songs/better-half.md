## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
I wrote this song back in the summer of 2012, when the cobra and I first started dating. I had gone on a couple auditions for community theaters , and hadn't made it past callbacks for any of them. I decided, in that moment, to write a musical.
Both this song and Diagnonsense were from the musical I attempted to write...about my mental health, call "Borderline." I know, it's hokey, but musicals are hokey, ok?!

Anyway, I wrote it, in part, about the cobra, but also about all my friends and loved ones. It's about wanting to scoop out all your rotten bits, so no one ever has to see them. I feel like that a lot, recently, so...it's getting revisited. It didn't make it on the last record and it's time it got some light.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
They say it's part of my condition
This thing that makes my bad decisions
Is just another of my symptoms
Always want to stop existing

But I don't wanna die
I just want that part inside of me
That wants to die
To die

I don't wanna go
I just want that part inside of me
That wants to go
To go

But I am not some corpse exquisite
I can't divide myself from symptom
Who knows what they will prescribe
For contemplating suicide

And I don't want to die
I just want that part inside of me
That wants to die
To die

I don't wanna go
I just want that part inside of me
That wants to go
To go

But if I could split myself in two
And leave the better half with you
We both know that's what I would do
I'd leave the better half with you
Just leave the better half
With you
