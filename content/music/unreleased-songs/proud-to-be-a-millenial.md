{{< lyrics >}}
My friend launched his startup during senior year
Now he's making millions, and I'm scrounging change for beer
If tomorrow I could pay my rent, that would be pretty great
But this entry-level job I tried for went to someone twice my age

And I'm proud to be a millenial, even though I work for free
Sometimes my friends will text and drive, but that shit just isn't me
And I'll gladly stand up to baby boomers, who get on my case
Cause I swear to god, it's not my fault
I was raised this way

From the barren codes of Myspace, to the feeds of Instagram
I'll post a fucking selfie if I want to, cause I can
You may think it's narcissism, but that just isn't true
We're saying you can be beautiful just by being you

And I'm proud to be a millenial, with an internship or three
And I won't forget how much I paid for my useless degree
And I'll gladly stand up for the rights, of hipsters, blacks, and gays
So don't get mad, it's not my fault
The world made me this way

Yes, I'm proud to be a millenial, though you say I should feel shame
I'm sure the generation before you has felt the same
So I'll gladly stand up to every think-piece posted on your wall
We didn't tank the economy
It's really not our fault
