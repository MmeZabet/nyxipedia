## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
I started writing this as a rap, but decided on this kind of Alanis Morisette trip hop vibe instead. I've recently gotten into using my full vocal range more often, and doing more dense harmonies. I tend to stick to the same couple intervals, musically, and I'm trying to branch out.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
You called me a bitch so now I’m gonna act it
How you gonna play when you're always skipping practice
Set up for the game but nobody’s reactin'
Nobody’s reaction nobody’s reactin'
I’ll say what I have to say
I’ll do what I have to do
I’ll play how I have to play
If it stops you

You called me a bitch so now I am an actress
Life is but a play and I’m at every practice
Set up’s just a game and you’re overreacting
You’re overreacting, your overreaction
You hear what you want to hear
You’ll do what you want to do
You say what you want, my dear
Nothing stops you

You called me a bitch so now I’m gonna act it
How you gonna play when you’re always skipping practice
Set up for the game but nobody’s reactin'
Nobody’s reaction nobody’s reactin'
