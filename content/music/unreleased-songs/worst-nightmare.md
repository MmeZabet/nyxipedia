## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I'm the kind of girl who makes fun of your friends,
The girl who doesn't think of being sweet or even kind,
The girl who doesn't ever look before she starts to laugh,
The girl who'd rather run and wave and scream a nonsense rhyme.

Your worst nightmare!
Coming to your school.
Your worst nightmare!
The anti-cool.
Your worst nightmare!
Who cares about rules.
Your worst nightmare!

I'm the strange Miss Universe candidate.
The one with weird hair who's hobby's kind of whack.
The girl who doesn't baton twirl and never would cheerlead.
The girl who hates pink and would rather wear all black!
