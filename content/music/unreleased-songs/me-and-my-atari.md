## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
When I was 14, for Christmas, my mother bought me recording time. $45 an hour, for me to play my pink electric guitar on my crummy 12" amp and sing about...whatever it is 14 year old girls sing about.
In my case, it was a video game system I didn't own. I have always been into retro culture, and video games, but we all know I'm a terrible gamer. Just ask the cobra; he has spent many hours watching me baffled by even the most basic game mechanics. I think I might be able to manage Pong, realistically.

However, even at 14, I knew nostalgia was a hot commodity, and I liked the band The Ataris and had brothers 18+ years my senior so I knew what one was.

Me and My Atari was born.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Here I am, sitting here with my T.V.
Here I am, sitting all alone
Man, I wish I still had my Atari
Man, I wish that it would come home

I remember those Friday nights, we played tons of games
All my friends would come over, and we'd talk pretty late

And it's okay
Hey hey hey

Cause it's just me and my Atari
Man, I knew we would go far
It's just me and my Atari
Living on Snapple and cereal bars
Just me
And my
Atari
Just me
And my
Atari

Here I am, sitting here on the old couch
With the [[unintelligible]], and the 70's swirl
Nothing here can straighten my slouch
I am truly an Atari girl

I remember those humid summer nights, in my garage
Everything was perfect then, and our game boxes became a collage

And it's okay
Hey hey hey

Cause it's just me and my Atari
Man, I knew we would go far
It's just me and my Atari
Living on Snapple and cereal bars
Just me
And my
Atari
Just me
And my
Atari

Cause it's just me and my Atari
Man, I knew we would go far
It's just me and my Atari
Living on Snapple and cereal bars
Just me
And my
Atari
Just me
And my
Atari
