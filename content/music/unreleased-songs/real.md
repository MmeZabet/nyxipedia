{{< lyrics >}}
I can still get dressed
I got out of bed
And it's not much yet
But I can't forget it's the first crucial step

To being better soon
And maybe later too
There's not much I can do
But sit here in my room and be the fool for you

And it's not what I wanted for myself
And I'm afraid that I'm not someone else
So I just keep doing my best to help
those hurts that I can heal
Just trying to be real

I don't want to lie
I'd rather stay inside
And I don't want to hide
but I can't deny it's easy not to try

And it's not what I want myself to say
But I can't pretend I'm not afraid
That I might accidentally overstay my
welcome or appeal
Just trying to be real
