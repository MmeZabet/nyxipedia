An encrypted conversation
Platforms primed for integration
Say you believe it
Say you believe it
Free yourself from your decisions
Adopt a new algorithm
We can achieve it
We can achieve it

Share a little more data, baby
Just sign on, just sign on
Cause tonight is the night
That three become one

We need content but haven't needed much before
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Don't need privacy, just show us some more
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Set your ethics free
It's the only way to be

Silly games and awkward glances
Gorge yourself on second chances
Let's do this right now
Let's do this right now
We can share the space forever
Just the three of us together
Take it or get out
Take it or get out

Gimme some of those connections baby
Turn 'em on, turn em on
Cause tonight is the night
That three become one

We need content but haven't needed much before
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Don't need privacy, just show us some more
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Set your ethics free
It's the only way to be

Be a little bit looser baby
Turn it on, turn it on
Cause tonight is the night
That three become one

We need content but haven't needed much before
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Don't need privacy, just show us some more
(Wanna own your assets baby)
We need content but haven't needed much before
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Don't need privacy, just show us some more
(Wanna own your assets baby)
Set your ethics free
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
