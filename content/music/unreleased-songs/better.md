I’m leaking music out of my bones right now. I think it might be because I went off my Cymbalta; it was supposed to be helping my nerve pain but it just made me suicidal. I’ve rejected my fair share of SSRIs and I don’t know why I thought this would be different. Now, it’s “just” Flexeril, prescription strength aspirin, 2 hour epsom salt baths, crystals, EFT tapping (I’ve gone full hippie), BCAAs, strength training, and my dry herb vape. And Percocet if shit gets *out of hand.*

I’ve always gotten poetic when I was sad, but it isn’t until recently that I’ve started to be able to use that part of me to express other emotions. At some point, I started keeping my music at arm’s length. I’ve been through a lot of weird producer/manager/boyfriend/client relationships that promised a lot of things that didn’t happen or asked things of me I wasn’t ready to give. I’ve taken lessons but I didn’t go to school for music. I didn’t even go to college. I’m not related to anyone famous, nor do I come from money. I’ve just stumbled upon crazy opportunity after crazy opportunity and risked life and limb to make my life an adventure. I’m constantly waiting for Them to Figure Out I’m not really a Musician.

Right now, my equally reckless adventure partner is asleep next to me, having passed out due to my excellent lullaby skills. You can hear me playing for him on this weird Dropbox link, sorry, can’t upload direct to Patreon from my phone.

Thank you for making my life possible. This song is as much for all of you as it is for him. I really will be here forever keeping the lights on in Wonderland if I’m allowed.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I don't know what I did to deserve you
Maybe it's the troubles that I've been through
Maybe all that bad luck finally did good
You make me think, maybe it could

I want to be more than what I have been
I believe our happiness can happen
Honestly I would be okay just to survive
I would be delighted with fine

I don't have much money but I do have love and time
I cannot repay the debts I owe
I hope you don't mind me singing you some words that rhyme
How else am I supposed to let you know

You make me better
You make me better
No matter the weather
Life is good when we're together
You make me better
You make me better
No matter the weather
Life is good when we're together

What do you say we do this forever?

You can't know the paths that I've taken
How little I've learned from my mistaken
Adventures that continually lead me to my doom
You'd think I'd learn to stay in my room

I don't have much money but somehow I've got this
Gotta hope that this can be enough
Call it natural talent but I work hard for this shit
Sorry if I sound a little rough
Living like I do, it makes you tough

You make it better
You make it better
No matter the weather
Life is good when we're together
You make me better
You make me better
No matter the weather
Life is good when we're together

What do you say we do this forever?
