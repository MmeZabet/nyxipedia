Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah yeah yeah

Love can be cruel sometimes
And not everything can take away your pain
But it will be fine
When you got your sunshine, it started to rain

It'll be okay
It'll be better again
It'll be okay
It'll be okay
Better now than then
It'll be okay

Let's go!
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah

So much heartbreak in the world
Sometimes it can't be cured but it's okay for you
It's worse he's got another girl
No you've started crying, locked up in your room

It'll be okay
It'll be better again
It'll be okay
It'll be okay
Better now than then
It'll be okay

Let's go!
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
