I'm
Just
Clicking through my feed
Seeing
Which
Of my friends are pregnant
Or maybe getting married to someone that I hate
I hear a pop
My heart stops
I have a new message
It's
Not
Someone that I know
Their name is
In a
Language I don't speak
Their profile picture is of a hot girl
I think I kinda know what's coming to me...

Don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Oh, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
No, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Pictures of your dick to strangers

Everybody!

Don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Oh, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
No, do
Not send me 
A photo of your dick
Pictures of your dick to strangers

(Spoken)
Hmm.  How do I get this person to like me?
I know!

(sung)
I'll send them
A picture of my cock
I've never said a word to them
In my life
But this photo of my genitals
Really gets the point across!

Don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Oh, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
No, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Pictures of your dick to strangers

Everybody!

Don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Oh, don't
Send
Pictures of your dick
Oh, do
Not send me 
A photo of your dick
Pictures of your dick to strangers
