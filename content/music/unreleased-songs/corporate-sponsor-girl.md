## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Glowing with synergy
Optimizing energy
Living in an automatic world
You have your spot in line
That status suits you fine
Would you be my corporate sponsored girl?

Interoffice romance must be disclosed or we’re fired
But for you I’d go to HR to sign the forms required

Zoom zoom zoom, make my sales go boom boom
My corporate sponsored girl

Dreaming of your pretty face
Reminds me how you know your place
In our perfect capitalist world
If it weren’t for Corpy Spons
We all would be dead and gone
Would you be my corporate sponsored girl
