## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
So, this goofy phrase popped into my head this morning; 2 Poor 2 Flex, numeric linguistic situation included. I knew that it deserved an equally goofy rap to match...

So I busted this out of my brain today. The arrangement isn't finished; it needs more than just bass and drums as far as instrumentation goes, and the mix is rough, but the ideas are there.

Trying to think of what to include in the music video, though. Definitely gotta have a scene where I'm flaunting me wealth of 2-3 singles.

Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
I ain’t even bother buying checks 
bank account is dead so pay respects
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor to flex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
ain’t got stacks to stack the deck
Can’t afford drugs, so I’ll just have sex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex

Now listen up, little girl
It’s a mother fuckin hard world
And even though we all know that you work hard girl 
I think your sights are set just a little too far girl
But hey, that’s okay
Money can’t buy you love anyway
Honestly, honeybee, money’s fake
we can split a pack of ramen it’s a perfect date
and if we feel a little frisky
get a little whiskey
gonna be cheap cause we gotta be thrifty 
cut it with all this lemonade
cause when life gives you lemons that’s what you made
hey, don’t let it get you sour, what?
sure, money has power but,  
who really wants an ivory tower? 
if what’s mine is yours, then what’s mine is ours

Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
I ain’t even bother buying checks 
My bank account is dead so pay respects
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor to flex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
I ain’t got stacks to stack the deck
Can’t afford drugs, so I’ll just have sex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex

“no liquid in your assets? you should work harder”
says the man in the desert with a bucket of water
“no liquid in your assets? you should work harder”
says the man in the desert with a bucket of water
“no liquid in your assets? well, you should work harder”
says the man in the desert with a bucket of water
so I wanna hear you holla if you haven’t got a dollar
in either your pockets or the pockets from your father 

Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
I ain’t even bother buying checks 
My bank account is dead so pay respects
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor to flex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
I ain’t got stacks to stack the deck
Can’t afford drugs, so I’ll just have sex
Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex

Cause I’m 2 poor, 2 poor 2 flex
