## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
I'm (tentatively, sort of) working on a concept album; the working title is Seven Spells. I'm still in the beginning fooling around stages of how I want it to sound, and this is my first attempt worth posting.
This spellsong is an invocation for adequate finances; I put out a call on Twitter for what folks would want me to sing about as their resident bard. Money problems was among the many suggestions, and as I may be finally getting somewhere with my clown-blackface-lawsuit situation (FINGERS CROSSED!!!), I wanted to tackle that one first. I need me a moneymaking song.

Here's hoping this songs finds you well and that it's purposeful pagan-ish prose help you make that paper.

What other songs get you hype to put in the work?

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Underneath the cedar tree
With the pine and poppy seeds
Gifts of honey and citrine
That I bathed in my belief
So listen closely

All I want will come to me
I'm gonna get all that I need
Livin' how I always dreamed
Just endless gold and ample green
All I want will come to me
I'm gonna get all that I need
Livin' how I always dreamed
Just endless gold and ample green
Ample green

Learned to ask for what was mine
Had to read between the lines
Told myself over and over
That I would be fine
That good things come with time
But might not always rhyme

All I want will come to me
I'm gonna get all that I need
Livin' how I always dreamed
Just endless gold and ample green
All I want will come to me
I'm gonna get all that I need
Livin' how I always dreamed
Just endless gold and ample green
Ample green

All I want will come to me
All I want will come to me

Underneath the cedar tree
With the pine and poppy seeds
Gifts of honey and citrine
Endless gold and ample green
Ample green
