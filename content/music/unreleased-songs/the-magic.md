## Background
Kate took inspiration for this song from The Coloring Book of Shadows.  The title is not necessarily final.

I am not a prayer person.  I don't, like, talk out loud to a deity very often.  I have maybe a few times.  I don't necessarily know that I believe in a deity.  I believe that witchcraft has power over us because we believe in it, which I think is true of basically anything.  And if we want to believe in witchcraft, then that's the thing that can have power over us.  But, um, there's a spell in it that's for self power, and the words of the spell were, "I am the magic, I am the guide, the magic is power, the magic is inside."  And I didn't want to just say it out loud, because I felt goofy, so I sang it.  And as I started repeating it, I was like, "You know what?  I think I could actually write a whole song, like based off of this."  And the woman who wrote Coloring Book of Shadows actually has-- I posted a video of it on Instagram at one point, and she has responded and said that she enjoys it.  So that's nice!  It was sort of a collaborative effort between myself and another artist, even as incidentally as it was.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside
Power is inside

Fighting battles I alone can win
Asking god for too damn long to save me from my sins
Holy father never helped before
Call upon our mother to end this bloody war

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside
The power is inside

I am the ready maiden, strong and fair
I am the mother of the land, the ocean's rightful heir
I am crone, wise and silver haired
I am the goddess, and the god, the answer to my prayers

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside
The power is inside

The magic is mine, I had it this whole time
I can see past my disease and know that I am good inside
I might not be perfect, but at least I'm trying
I'm doing just fine, I'm doing just fine

The magic is mine, I had it this whole time
I can see past my disease and know that I am good inside
I might not be perfect, but at least I'm trying
I'm doing just fine, I'm doing just fine

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside

I am the magic
I am the guide
The magic is power
The power is inside
The power is inside
