## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Baby baby, where do I begin?
You got a body that was made for sin
Can't believe that you look so damn fine
God I'm lucky that I made you mine

Don't you notice, can't you tell, I want it bad as hell

Got a question that I need to ask
Where you think you're goin' lookin' like that?
Is there some way I can keep you home
I'd rather not do what I want to alone

You're the kind of mess that I wanna make
You're the kind of risk that I wanna take
You've got lover written all over your face
So come on over here and make a couple mistakes

I hope you get what I'm tryin' to say
Don't know how to put it any other way
All I'm askin for is a little something-something
No offense, doll, but I din't marry you for nothin'

You're the kind of mess that I wanna make
You're the kind of risk that I wanna take
You've got lover written all over your face
So come on over here and make a couple mistakes

I know you think that I'm just makin' fun
Listen up, lover, we've only just begun
You know what they say about women who are crazy
I won't go into detail, after all, I am a lady

Won't you notice, can't you tell, I want it bad as hell
