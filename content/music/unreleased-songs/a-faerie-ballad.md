## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
As many of you know, last year, one of our external hard drives crashed, losing us over a decade of videos, music, and various other projects.

Fortunately, I was able to locate some of my music and lyrics on my old laptop, which has stayed on long enough for me to transfer them over to another hard drive.

This song is still kind of unnamed; the title of the document for the lyrics is "Compare thee", the file is called "a faerie ballad" and I think I released it on MySpace at some point under the title "siren song". This version was recorded sometime in late 2009, early 2010.

What would you call this song?

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
A faerie's heart beats fierce and free
No mortal man can one contain
But if thou givest love to me
With the I shall always remain

Compare thee no one's lips to mine
Let their thoughts not go astray
Drink thy fill of faerie's wine
And with thee I'll always stay

A winged empress not at court
A danger to a [[unintelligible]] sidhe
If thou givest thy support
I shall give myself to thee

Compare mine eyes to no one's eyes
[[unintelligible]]
Let there be no [[unintelligible]]
To unchain my lips from thine

(Vocalizing)

A single sip is all it takes
Together we'll forever be
An elfstruck man, a fool does make
I will unmake it all for thee
He shall be unmade for me
(x4)
