## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I can feel it crawling up my throat
I can feel it begging me to take over
Suddenly it's threatening to choke
I sound like I'm sky high when I'm stone cold sober
And my face is turning red
And there's burning in my head
I've still got some learning left to do

She's so pretty I could die
So much prettier than I
Comparison's the death of joy
But you're too good to be true

I see in the comments that you're loved
I see strangers promise that they're your backup
God, your public just can't get enough
I guess I just happen to be Little Miss Bad Luck
And my eyes are turning green
My psyche is a murder scene
Why do I want to be mean to you?

You're so pretty I could die
So much prettier than I
Comparison's the death of joy
But you're too good to be true

I wish I was better than I am
I wish I could be the me that didn't do this
I guess that I'll just stick to the plan
I know that the only way out is through this
