## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I burned so bright I turned to ash
Or dimmed my light to suit the task
I did everything that you ask
At least what I could manage 

I gave my breath until I choked
I watch the rest go up in smoke
Like some sick biblical joke
I seem to operate on damage

When I wished upon that star
I didn’t know it’d get this far
All I want is to make art
Why keep trying so damn hard

I just want to love myself
I just want to love myself
I don’t want anyone else
I just want to love myself

You can see it in my eyes
I don’t believe a word I’m saying
They’re not technically lies
It’s just different games we’re playing

I collect your admiration
To make up for what I lack
But when I’m not th e subject of constant adulation
It might as well be fade to black

I just want to love myself
I just want to love myself 
I don’t want anyone else
I just want to love myself 

Who’d have thought so, who’s have guessed 
That this would be my final test 
I should have seen it coming, yet
Here we fucking stand

Who’s the victim, what’s the crime
There’s no yellow tape in sight
So why does it feel like I’m dying
Trying to stay alive?
