This here song is about barely concealed lividness.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
It burns inside of me, hot as any flame
It hurts the pride in me to call it out by name
If I don't let it out, it's anyone's guess
What I will do next to sabotage success

Rage
Rage

I sit here quietly.  I can't let you see
If I wait silently, maybe I'll concede
But I don't see the wall before the crash
Just like in the past, my happy cannot last

Rage
Rage
Rage
Rage
