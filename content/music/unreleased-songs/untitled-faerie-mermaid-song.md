## Background
During S01E20064, Kate was commissioned to create a brief song.  The viewer requested a song about faeries and mermaids making art together.  Initially she was working on it via guitar, but switched to ukulele after getting the lyrics where she wanted them.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Where sea meets the shore
Where the roots find mossy floors
Where the flowers grow
That is is where we'll go

Our paintbrushes intertwined
Matching hearts and mismatched minds
I will put in overtime
For bubbles and for brine

Underneath the waves
That is where we'll spend our days
Love and laugh and play
And above all, create
And above all, create
