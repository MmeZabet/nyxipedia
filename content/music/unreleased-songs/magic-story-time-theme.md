## Background

One of my best friends is an incredible magician, married to an incredible magician, and they do a livestream show called Magic Story Time. I'm currently working on writing them a show theme, and this is my first attempt.

Music is one of those things that sometimes it comes to me all at once and sometimes I'm ramming my head against something for a year before I finally consider it done (like Supernova Girl).

We'll see which one this is! The inspiration I was given was a modern Reading Rainbow theme, and also the band The Bird and The Bee

Magic story
Magic story
Magic story time

Magic story
Magic story
Magic story time

Every day we turn the page
In search of an adventure
Weaving [[unintelligible]]
That show you signs of splendor
These thrilling tales of setting sails
To worlds of our creations
The greatest magic ever known
Is your imagination

Magic story
Magic story
Magic story time
(Your imagination)

Magic story
Magic story
Magic story time
(Your imagination)
