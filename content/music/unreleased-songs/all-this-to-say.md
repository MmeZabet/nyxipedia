## Background
Kate had this stuck in her head the day before Thanksgiving 2021, and demoed it live on Instagram that day.  Various keys were tried, but she hadn't settled on one yet at the time of this writing.  According to her, it's going back to her pop-punk roots and she was inspired to write it after seeing that Avril Lavigne had released new music.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I’ve been trying to hide that I am still losing my mind
I thought that someday I would find what I can’t feel
As appealing as that sounds, therapy ain’t lost and found
It can run you in the ground to learn the truth
That no one else can do the work but you

All of this to say I’m fucking losing it again
And I’ve been trying to pretend
That I don’t want to meet my end
All of this to say I’m sorry I can’t fix my face
I know it gives it all away
That I can feel every mistake
If I could be, I would be okay

As you all can see, I’m still grasping desperately
At what’s left of my sanity, but I’m still here
It might not look like much, it sure feels like not enough
And I am losing touch with my reality
But at least the one who feeling it still feels like me

All of this to say I’m fucking losing it again
And I’ve been trying to pretend
That I don’t want to meet my end
All of this to say I’m sorry I can’t fix my face
I know it gives it all away
That I can feel every mistake
If I could be, I would be okay

I know that I am better than when this happened before
But I still feel like a failure when I’m weeping on the floor
Because I paid so much money not to do this anymore
But recovery’s not linear, so I’ll see you all again I’m sure
