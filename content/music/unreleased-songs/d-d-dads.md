## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
The photographer who shot my Philly Weekly is starting a podcast called D&D Dads; it's going to be about fatherly advice, and RPGs. This is the theme I was commissioned to write for it!

We've some fatherly advice
Come with us and roll the dice
There's no judgment to be had
Just fun and family
With your D&D dads
