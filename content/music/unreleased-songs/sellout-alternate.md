## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I’m so glad that I have sold out
Full endorsed, got off that high horse
Now it’s time to make some money
I’m glad somebody sees 
I make the perfect face
For their branded direction
No hidden intentions
Got tired of being poor
Baby, I’m off that high horse

I’m so glad that I have sold out
All expenses paid for a simple serenade
I’m finally happy, somebody slap me
Got that contract and the car
That million dollar deal bought at least a few meals
Once divided per the form
Baby, I’m off that high horse

I’ve no need to be facetious, good friends
I’ve finally paid my business expense
Just a couple lines of law and a pen
I’m theirs until the fiscal year ends

I’m so glad I finally sold out
Who can find creative drive when you’re trying to survive
Couldn’t pay the debts I owed, couldn’t keep my show afloat
I got tired of being poor
So now I’m off that high horse
I’m off that high horse
I can’t find my high horse
