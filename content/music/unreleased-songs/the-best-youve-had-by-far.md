"I just want you to love me like you love all the others."  Is it about my dad?  Is it about the general public?  The world will never know!

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Just want you to love me like you love all of the others
See me when you look up at the stars
Just want you to love me like loved him like you love her
Wanna be your champagne, caviar

Don't I burn bright enough?
Don't I provide enough?
Don't I confide enough?
Or am I coming off too tough?
Don't I go fast enough?
Don't I move past enough?
I play a little gruff
I guess I'm just asking too much

Just want you to love me like you love all of the others
See me when you look up at the stars
Just want you to love me like loved him like you love her
Wanna be your champagne, caviar
The best you've had by far

I can't shoot low enough
I can't move slow enough
Why do I care so much
About whether or not I grow enough?
Guess I'm not smart enough
I don't work hard enough
If I restart enough
Will that tear me apart enough?

Just want you to love me like you love all of the others
See me when you look up at the stars
Just want you to love me like loved him like you love her
Wanna be your champagne, caviar
The best you've had by far
The best you've had by far

God forbid my thirteen chances
God forbid the same romances
God forbid stable finances, too
God forbid career advancement
God forbid I'm out of cantrips
God forbid my dreams from coming true

Just want you to love me like you loved all of the others
See me when you look up at the stars
I just want you to love me like loved him like you love her
Wanna be your champagne, caviar
The best you've had by far
(x4)
