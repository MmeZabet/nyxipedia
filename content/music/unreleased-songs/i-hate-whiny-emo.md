## Background
A "Baby Got Back Catalog" from Kate's early days, we were lucky enough to hear this live.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
"Cry me a river,
My girlfriend left me,"
It's what all the emo boys say
You can't hear the rhythm,
You can't hear the music
His crying gets in the way

'Cause I hate whiny emo!

I hate whiny emo, I hate whiny emo,
All you boys you better shut up!
'Cause I hate whiny emo!
I hate whiny emo, I hate whiny emo,
All you boys you better shut up!
'Cause I hate whiny emo!

He can't stop his crying,
He can't stop his whining,
It's a wonder he even gets paid,
If he'd stop obsessing,
Over his ex-Jessie,
Maybe he'd finally get laid

'Cause I hate whiny emo!
