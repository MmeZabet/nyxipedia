{{< lyrics >}}
Just mindin' my own business, not trying to catch your eye
You decided to come talk to me about what's on your mind
I'm a pretty open person, yeah, that'd normally be fine
You went on some shameful spiel about how I should live my life

Don't block the box
Don't block the box
Really, who are you to say who I can and cannot lay?
I don't really care if you think that I'm a slut
Do me a favor, doll; don't block the box!

So, now that we've covered that, it's all you need to know
It doesn't really matter if you stay or if you go
You don't get to tell me who I let into my bed
And you do not get to say a word on how I should or should not dress

Don't block the box
Don't block the box
Really, who are you to say who I can and cannot fuck?
I don't really care if you think that I'm a slut
Do me a favor, doll; don't block the box!

Don't block the box
Don't block the box
Really, who are you to say who I can and cannot fuck?
I don't really care if you think that I'm a slut
Do me a favor, doll; don't block the box!
