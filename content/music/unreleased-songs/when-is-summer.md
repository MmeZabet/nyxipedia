{{< lyrics >}}
Sitting here at my desk,
Staring at the clock,
Only thirty minutes left,
Doodlin' on my paper,
In my math notebook,
Drawing the teacher I hate most.

When is summer, I don't know,
We're still having sleet and snow
When I'm free, I don't know,
All I want to do is go
Gonna go insane, it's taking over my brain
Driving me crazy.  Driving me crazy.

Bell finally rings,
Free of all teachers,
For only about three minutes,
People everywhere,
Screaming in the halls,
Only 6 more classes to go.

Chorus

I can't believe it's finally summer now,
And how much I wanted to get out,
All I really had to do was wait,
But what I said back then was very true.

Chorus (x2)

Drivin' me crazy
(goes on forever well actually only five times)
