{{< lyrics >}}
Not a second to waste, I need my sage and silver bullets
got a witchy trigger finger, and you know I wanna pull it
Light the bonfire, bang the drum, wear a long black dress
They think they seen the last of us
They ain’t seen nothing yet

Fetch me my pearls and fetch my pistol,
Get me my lipstick and my crystals
Don’t dry your tears we’re gonna need them
Now face your fears, you’re gonna see them<br>Get your ass off my stiletto
Guess you didn’t get the memo
Now has come the time
You’ll pay for your crime

Let’s call it what it is; egos wounded for survival
The battle of the sexes now becoming bitter rivals
Lace your boots up, ring the bell, history’s on our side
What do you think matters more
My safety or your pride?

Fetch me my pearls and fetch my pistol,
Get me my lipstick and my crystals
Don’t dry your tears we’re gonna need them
Now face your fears, you’re gonna see them<br>Get your ass off my stiletto
Guess you didn’t get the memo
Now has come the time
You’ll pay for your crime

Someday you’ll get your turn to speak
Maybe wait a couple weeks
The only thing you need to do
Is treat us like you’ve treated you

Fetch me my pearls and fetch my pistol,
Get me my lipstick and my crystals
Don’t dry your tears we’re gonna need them
Now face your fears, you’re gonna see them<br>Get your ass off my stiletto
Guess you didn’t get the memo
Now has come the time
You’ll pay for your crime
