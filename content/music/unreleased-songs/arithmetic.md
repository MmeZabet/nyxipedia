## Background
At one point, Kate was working on a project to write or record a new song every day in the month of August.  This is one that came out of that project.  This song has never had a dedicated recording, other than the YouTube video.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Let's do the math
First subtract
The three years that passed in tears
That I'll never get back
So relax
I'm not a scholar
But I'm willing to bet at least a couple dollars
That I'm better off without the stress
Caused by that whole fuckin' mess
But I still can't forget the shit
That I let him get away with

But back
To the point
You plus me equals
God who knows
Let's see how the equation goes
Oh, you plus me equals
God who knows
Let's see how the equation goes

So four years
Minus the tears
Is a year or so
And I still didn't let go
I hold on
To my hope
And here we are, four months or so
Into something wonderful
Well at least it is so far
Subtract the months we've spent apart
Waiting to see
I wouldn't run
So what are we at?
Two months?  One?

But back
To the point
You plus me equals
God who knows
Let's see how the equation goes
Oh, you plus me equals
God who knows
Let's see how the equation goes

So what does does that leave us with?
Two years ago was our first kiss
Does that add to our progress?
Or is this a numeric mess?
Imagining that
Someday maybe
There could be a little family
Would just be more than you and me
But a solid single we

I guess the way
To say it best is
You're my favorite hypothesis
That's all I want
Mathematically
Oh, you plus me equals we
You plus me equals we
