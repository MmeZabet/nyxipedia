## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Corporate Sponsor knows where you sleep
They monitor all of your dreams
They know when you cry and you scream
Their observance keeps us all clean, indeed

Systems engage, protocol saved
The Network provides
Under control, we are all whole
Thank you for our lives
We thrive

It’s impressive all that they know
They can see you watching the show
They know when you’re sad and alone
To protect our family and homes, we grow

Systems engage, protocol saved
The Network provides
Under control, we are all whole
Thank you for our lives
We thrive
