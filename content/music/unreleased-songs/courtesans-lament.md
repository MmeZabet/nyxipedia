## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Slit me dry and cut me open
Hope my blood will leave you choking
Everyone thought I was joking
But look at me now
Kiss the peasant, hate the princes
Litter me with scorn and winces
There is nothing to convince me
That you’re all alone

You thought if you talked to me long enough
I’d end up in lingerie
But it takes more than a couple of words
To get a girl in negligee
That’s right, monsieur, life is my cabaret

You thought I was more your type
Now you’ve wasted all your time
Truth is, I’m losing my mind
And kisses aren’t pills
Dancing girls and blackened windows
Sex is growing in the meadows
Will you please supply the shadow
For this nightmare to begin

You thought if you talked to me long enough
I’d end up in lingerie
But it takes more than a couple of words
To get a girl in negligee
That’s right, monsieur, life is my cabaret

Sing to me, Master of Ceremonies
This courtesan wants a new song
As long as I sit here and peddle my time
I know the patrons and I’ll get along

You thought if you talked to me long enough
I’d end up in lingerie
But it takes more than a couple words
To get a girl in negligee
That’s right, monsieur, life is my cabaret
