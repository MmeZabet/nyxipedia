## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Okay, hit it!

Thirty and three
The goblin must be
Before she can know
Her destiny

Album must she make
To become True Kate
In order to break
The curse of her fate (Yeah!)

Forty-two days and 
Forty-two nights
Must come and go
Before it takes flight

If she can't best this test
To complete her quest
She cannot remain
The Goblin Princess

Word. (To your mother.)
