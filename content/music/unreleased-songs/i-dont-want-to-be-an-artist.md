## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I don’t want to be an artist
I don’t think I want to starve
Sure I do love to draw and paint but
Someday I’d like to own a car
And I don’t want to make my living 
Doing song and dance 
unfortunately,
It’s destiny
And art is who I am

I don’t want to be unique, no
What I'd give to just fit in
To be comfy in my status quo
What it would be to feel akin
To the average joe who,
Don’t you know,
Turns his work in on time
Unfortunately,
It’s destiny,
So the artiste am I 

I’d love to have a 9 to 5 I trudged through every day
Cursing my boss for keeping me criminally underpaid
Maybe if I was normal I would finally be free
‘Cause every year the government would send a check to me

I didn’t mean to be a creator
I didn’t mean to tell a joke
At some point I had to admit
My plans for life went up in smoke
I was cursed to make my living selling what I make
Unfortunately,
Between you and me,
I think destiny is fake!

At first I thought that I was gripped by siren songs of fame
That I just wanted the whole world to remember my name
Or is it that I want to lie to everyone I meet
When someone asks what I do for a living on the street

I don’t want be an artist
I don’t want to feel the pain
Of failing at something you care about
And publicly admitting shame
I just want to make things I like and do nothing else at all
Fortunately,
For you and me,
“Artist” is what that’s called
