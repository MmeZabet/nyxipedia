Been on a nostalgia trip preparing for this video about my first recording experience, making my album "To My Sisters. . ." This is one of the tracks from that record; track 8 of 9, to be exact.

A little backstory;

Surprising exactly no one, I had difficulty fitting in at school. I was the subject of a lot of rumors; I was one of the first goths in my middle school and it kind of went downhill from there. When I missed the first three weeks of 8th grade because of a custody dispute between my parents, things only got weirder.

I distinctly remember a group of boys paying me to leave a room once at a dance, after trying to scare me of with some paper crosses; another time, I was asked if I "really believed I was a raven", which didn't even make sense to me. I was a natural antagonist, so it was really just fuel for the fire.

I don't know if I decided being weird was cool and acted weird, or if I was realizing I was weird and decided that I liked it that way. Either way, originality has always been a theme in my life. Sometimes, I worry my quest for "originality" in my youth has made me innately Too Weird to be understood be other people. I don't know that I have a choice but to be this way, though, anymore.

Either way, the statement I made then still rings true.

It's all I'm trying to be.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I dyed my hair blonde, I tried to be "prep"
I wore all the cool clothes, but I got sick of it
I dyed my hair pink, I listened to Zepp
I tried to be "punk", but I got sick of it

Forget your expectations
I'm starting my own nation
The United States of Me
Forget the majority
Won't join your sorority
The United States of Me
It's all I'm trying to be
All I'm trying to be

Got my eyebrow pierced, and I wore all black
I tried to be "goth", but I got sick of it
Listened to Nirvana, ripped up all my pants
I tried to be "grunge", but I got sick of it

Forget your expectations
I'm starting my own nation
The United States of Me
Forget the majority
Won't join your sorority
The United States of Me
It's all I'm trying to be

Forget your expectations
I'm starting my own nation
The United States of Me
Forget the majority
Won't join your sorority
The United States of Me
It's all I'm trying to be
