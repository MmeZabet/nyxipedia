## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
I wrote a lot about dolls and dollhouses when I was a teenager. I've kind of gotten over the imagery as I got older; partially, I think, because I'm learning about what those metaphors meant to me as a writer. We talk a lot about my music in therapy; I go weekly or bi-weekly, depending on how I'm doing. My music is sometimes extremely forward and sometimes draped with metaphor and sometimes even I don't really know what the fuck I'm talking about until later in my life. I have a lot of secrets, even from myself, that effect my day to day life and how I interact with the world to an unbelievable degree. Looking back on my songs later gives me a clue as to how I deal with those secrets, and what I need to work through as an adult.
This song is a sweet little update on that theme: I'm not in the dollhouse anymore, nor am I made of salt, so me and the Orchestral Kit in Logic have some shit to say.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I'm not your doll
I'm not your pretty little thing
No, I don't want your diamond ring
I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
I'm not your pretty little girl
Don't want your ribbons or your pearls
I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
I'm not some trophy you can own
I wasn't made to keep your home
I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
I won't accessorize your life
Don't want a queen?  Don't get a wife
I'm not your doll

No, I do not want to play
I don't really like your game

I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
I wasn't put on this green earth
For my looks to make my worth
I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
So you can burn that picket fence
And I can refund your two cents
I'm not your doll

No, I won't play by your rules
No, I will not be your fool

I'm not your doll

I'm not your doll
