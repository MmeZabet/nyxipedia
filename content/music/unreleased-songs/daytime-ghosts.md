{{< lyrics >}}
How many chances do I give you to prove to me you think that I’m alive
How many times have I agreed because I was just trying to survive
It isn’t that I’m likable, I’m pliable, I bend to every will
So here I am searching for a way that I can finally be still

The things that I could never say
Are ghosts that haunt me every day
I wish that I was strong enough to speak
There is nothing transcendental
About being instrumental
To the untimely demise of your own being.

How many times do I correct you, as I wait for you to get there on your own
You mastered misdirecting me, while I was just trying to come home
But home is where the heart is and my heart was broken far too long ago
By a man who never wanted me, and a girl who didn’t want to be alone

The things that I could never say
Are ghosts that haunt me every day
They moan and bash their fists against the walls
But there is no spiritual guidance
To be found in self reliance
No one’s there to catch you when you fall

You were there but you were not
What I remembered you forgot
My memories unravel by the hour
I was lost, and I still am
I wanted more that what I had
So now I’m on my own to find the power

How many miles must I travel before the path can finally unwind
I’m beginning to wonder if I’ll finally ever learn to speak my mind
Whither shall I wander, spirit, show me how to seek and I will find
The way to prove, beyond all doubt, to myself I am worthy of my life.
