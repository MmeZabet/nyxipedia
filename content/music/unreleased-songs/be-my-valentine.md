## Background
This is a song Kate wrote at about 14 years old, and memorable and important because she played it for her first gig at a bar at 16 years old.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Got you candy
I bought you flowers
Stood outside your window
For three hours
Holding up a stereo like the guy in the movie did
Wrote you poems
Eight love letters
You don't like me
Any better
Do you think I'm serious, or do you think I'm just a kid?

Oh
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine

I'm not transparent
Can't you see me?
My love's not something
To be taken lightly
I'm goin' crazy.  Why won't you call me back?
I won't give up now
Won't surrender
Will keep trying
Never ender
Got me in your spiderweb, got my heart under attack

Oh
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine

My paper heart is burned
The tables have been turned
Whoa
Why can't I be yours?
Please open the door

And
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
I'm losin', losin', losin'
I'm losin' my mind
Be my, be my, be my
Be my valentine
