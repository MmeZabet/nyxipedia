## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
I was complaining on Twitter about not being able to put my gigs up on Spotify because they're all livestreams, but then Shark suggested I write a song about it! I recorded it on Twitch yesterday; it was the first time I ever recorded like that on a livestream and it was so much more difficult than recording by myself. I'm not sure how often that will happen in the future, but I hope those of you who stopped by learned at least a little something about how I make the magic happen.

Enjoy this surprisingly catchy jingle about the Lullaby Lounge.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I go live
Every Tuesday night at 8
Eastern Daylight Time that is
Where you are it might be later
It's a show
That I put on just for you
A musical spectacular
I sing, I dance, I play kazoo
And I just want to entertain
It's why I wrote you this refrain

K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
Oh! K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
That's where you'll find me
Singing for you every Tuesday night
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
Oh! K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
That's where you'll find me singing
Where you'll find me singing

I go live
Every Tuesday night at 8
Eastern Standard Time that is
Where you are it might be later
It's a show
That I make just for you
It's got puppets
It's got sketches
Good advice and goofy accents
And I hope you join us in the chat someday
My little one-woman cabaret

K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
Oh! K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
That's where you'll find me
Singing for you every Tuesday night
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
Oh! K-A-T-E-N-Y-X dot live
That's where you'll find me singing
Where you'll find me singing
