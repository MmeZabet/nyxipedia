{{< lyrics >}}
I spent my entire life looking for a bigger ship to tie to 
Drifting on an open ocean trying to find a swell that I can ride 
I wanted to be swept up in momentum of a present I could star in 
But I didn’t realize 
No I didn’t realize  

I was afraid to make waves 
I was afraid to make waves 
Surrounded by the sea, I was begging to be seen 
But I couldn’t convince myself to bear the weight of me 
I was afraid to make waves  

How many hours wasted trying to appease the great unknown 
How many fears I’ve faced but still I couldn’t stand feeling my pride
If it wasn’t from the outside how could I be sure it wasn't fantasy
No l didn’t realize
That this was real life  

I was afraid to make waves 
I was afraid to make waves 
Surrounded by the sea, I was trying to feel seen  
Waiting for someone to tell me how I could succeed 
I was afraid to make waves  

But now I know I can’t live in fear 
Only i can get me out of here 
I admit I should’ve seen it clear before 
But I no longer need to see the shore   

I’m not afraid to make waves 
No I was made to make waves 
Surrounded by the sea, I have built the life I lead, 
And no one on this earth can say I’m not living my dream 
I was made to make waves
I’m not afraid to make waves
