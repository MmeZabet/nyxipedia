## Background
{{< blockquote author="Kate Nyx" source="Patreon" >}}
Part of there reason why the tech streams had their own theme song is because this got stuck in my head for over a week. It's the first piece of music I've recorded with my new equipment, and I still have a lot to learn. I'm hoping to spend some time this summer educating myself more about music production and software.

Hope this helps those of you whose heads it was also stuck in!

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
This is not The Lullaby Lounge
This is not The Lullaby Lounge
You'll see some sights and you'll hear some sounds
But it's not The Lullaby Lounge

This is not The Lullaby Lounge
This is not The Lullaby Lounge
We appreciate having you around
But it's not The Lullaby Lounge

We appreciate having you around
But it's not The Lullaby Lounge
