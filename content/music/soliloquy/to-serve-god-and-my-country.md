## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Through dishonor and distrust
I'll burn, rip, and lust
I'll do my hair and makeup well
With a gun in my fair hand
I'll learn to slaughter men
I look like heaven, act like hell

It's just miscommunication
I'm not that bad of a girl
And when you put mine close together
We tend to destroy the world

On my honor I will try
My honor I will try
Your honor I tried
And I swear it's not a lie
It's not my fault she died
Your honor I tried

We're the scout troop 911
And we have all the fun
We bleed our victims to the bone
We are experts in our craft
And we're starting a draft
Join us!  You'll never be alone

It's just miscommunication
I'm not that bad of a girl
But when you put mine close together
We tend to destroy the world

On my honor I will try
My honor I will try
Your honor I tried
And I swear it's not a lie
It's not my fault she died
Your honor I tried

(spoken)
Stop her!
She was being difficult!
She's really quite stubborn when she wants to be!
Oh.
And she.
Well.
She's me.
She's me.

(singing)
On my honor I will try
My honor I will try
Your honor I tried
And I swear it's not a lie
It's not my fault she died
Your honor I tried

Won't somebody please believe me
Anyone out in the crowd
Just for once I'm not deceiving
Anybody but myself
