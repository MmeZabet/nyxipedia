## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
If you see me crying, call an ambulance
A doll ambulance, to be exact
Because pretty dollys don't have a chance
At a hospital with the human boys
They belong with the other toys

I found myself a pretty robot boy
But then they came and took him away
So now all I do is sit  and destroy
Myself all day all day all day all

It's all just a cry for help, kid
I'm begging not to be thrown out
Play with me just for a little while
I'll tell you what it's all about

If you see me scream, call a doctor
A doctor that can put me in a white room
And send someone to be proctor
So don't chew through my stitches
Just another of my glitches

How long will it take to fix me
Sir, I think I should just go home
Since you don't have anywhere to put me
And I'd rather be alone alone oh

It's all just a cry for help, love
I'm begging just to get out
Stay with me for just a little longer
And tell me what you're thinking about

Just keep talking so I can keep breathing
Just keep talking so I can keep breathing
Just keep talking so I can keep bleeding
Just keep talking so I can keep bleeding

If you see me crying, call an ambulance
A doll ambulance, to be exact
Because pretty dollys don't have a chance
At a hospital with the human boys
They belong with the other toys
(x4)
I belong with the other toys
