Honestly, I think there are maybe four passable songs on Soliloquy.  A lot of it is, like, industrial teenage screaming.  Emotional, industrial teenage screaming.  And, uh, yeah.  It just...  It's a ride.

Released on January 25th 2008, "soliloquy" was Hayley Jane's first studio release. The style of the album was evocative of the state she was in at the time: just barely 17, recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and about to make one of the biggest moves in her life to date- transferring her career from rural Pennsylvania to the Detroit metropolitan area.

On "soliloquy":

"Hayley Jane's songs are somehow just unique. She has a style of her own and this style changes faster than a doll can jump out of the window of the second floor of the toy box into the bin outside." - www.avantegarde-metal.com

On Hayley Jane:

"...Multitalented burlesque goddess..." - Metro Times, Detroit, MI

"Think this generation's Ani Difranco, but more cabaret." - Doug Coombe, Metro Times
