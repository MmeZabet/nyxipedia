{{< lyrics >}}
I'm pretty convinced
that there is something in the water
Cause every time I drink
I want to hide inside a slaughter

Drowning in a sea of blood
Is easier than facing love
We all know feelings are
A sign of weakness anyway

I may as well just swallow
while the ugly, sick and strange

There's no point in being pretty
If you don't have anything to say.
No point in putting makeup on
if you don't have to face the day

Duplicit from optimistic
To what you please just go away
Is he being tortured, starving
Please don't be alarmed my darling

It's just a part I'm playing
To keep the monsters out at bay

It's something about us artsy girls
that just makes creepy men go wild
Sorry sir but could you please
Give me some privacy I'm tired

I'm sitting here, takin in
Pretending I'm not full of shit
But would you even listen
if I was anywhere near honest
If I didn't lie and scheme and fake
empty promise after promise

No, you'd ignore me
I'd be boring
I'm only beautiful
When I'm bleeding

I feel pointless
Please adore me
I'm only sexy when I'm seething.
Seething

There's no point in being pretty
If you don't have anything to say.
No point in putting makeup on
if you don't have to face the day

Duplicit from optimistic
So please just fucking go away
Is he being tortured, starving
Please don't be alarmed my darling

It's just a part I'm playing
To keep the monsters out at bay
It's just a part I'm playing
To keep the monsters out at bay

I may as well just swallow
all the ugly sick and strange
I may as well just swallow
all the ugly sick and strange
