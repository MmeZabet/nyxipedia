{{< lyrics >}}
You have the blood and burial
My blood lines are stained and tainted
You were meant to be a royal
Were it not with my face unpainted
Look so good in fine attire
Look much better in blood covered rags
Your world comes with an angel's choir
My world is narrated by a chorus of hags

Bury your whore
Bury your whore
Bring me your bones and I'll adore you
Your precious lies
Nobody's sighs
Become screams if you do it right
Bury your whore
Bury your whore

I'll never be a queen
Neither will she
I took care of her, darling
And I'm fit with finery
But my reputation's anything but sparkling
Since you couldn't do the deed
Gladly obliged to make her suffer
And I was happy to watch her bleed
Now I know that you can never love her

Bury your whore
Bury your whore
Come to bed, don't close the door
You are the star
Of my broken heart
Open me up and pick me apart
Bury your whore
Bury your whore

Morning glory
Let me tell you a story
Morning glory
Her fated death was rather gory
Her blood was everywhere
On my dress and in my hair
Bits of bone adorn the floor
For once and for all I buried your whore
For once and for all I buried your whore
