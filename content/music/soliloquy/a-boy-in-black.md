## Background

This song is the last song on <i>Soliloquy</i>, and I think it shows where I was headed as far as where my tone was musically.  Um.  It's one of the first songs I wrote that I think was, like, making people-- er, showing my colors as I moved forward.  There's these like, sort of, middle songs that either happen on the end of the record, or in between records, like <b>Fix the Girl</b> was sort of the between of <i>To My Sisters...</i> and <i>Soliloquy</i>.  And then the between <i>Soliloquy</i> and <i>idiot child.</i> is this song, which is the last song on the record.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
L O V E
Spells the way you looked at me
And I can not speak
Looking through the pictures from that first week
You say it hurts
Here's an hourglass for what it's worth
You can't tell your friends
That we aren't talking again

And oh
Oh no
There's no point in hiding
I love you so
Here's to you
And all the shit I push you through

There is no way
I can't say the things I say
And I will not wake
My dreams are what's helping my heartache
Hide if you must
I won't stop until I've gained your trust
No shred of doubt
Because I will burn it all out

Oh
Oh no
There's no point in hiding
I love you so
Here's to you
And all the shit I push you through

L O V E
Spells the way we used to be
And I can't go back
I'm just a girl in love with a boy in black
(x3)
