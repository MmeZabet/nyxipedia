{{< lyrics >}}
You bottled all the blood I bled
I could care less if you were dead
You bleached my black and dyed it red
I could care less if you were dead
Is she pretty when her legs are spread
I could care less if you were dead
Apologies mean nothing, pet
And now I say, off with her head

You know better than to mess with the queen
It's gonna be the prettiest war you've ever seen
Off with her head
(x4)

So let's review the things I've said
I could care less if you were dead
Though I forgive, I won't forget
I could care less if you were dead
I know, I know, you so regret
I could care less if you were dead
But doll you ain't seen nothin' yet
And now I say, off with her head

You know better than to mess with the queen
Especially when it comes to these sort of things
Off with her head
(x4)

She's so much prettier in red
She's so much prettier in red
She's so much prettier in death
She's so much prettier in death
And now I say, off with her head
(x4)
