## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I'm feeling wasted
I feel abused
I need everything
I have to lose
I'm sick of being there
I'm sick of being sad
I'm ready for the rapture
I might as well be dead

Speak little dolly
Give me a clue
To the secret to be
Half as pretty as you
I need the porcelain
I need the gears
Because I know
That if I don't
I will end up in tears

(vocalizing)

I don't care if you say I'm pretty
I don't care if you say I'm nice
All I know is when the clock strikes twelve
Nothing is ever right
Because it's midnight

Give me a needle
Give me a pill
I need no papers
I have no will
I'm used to sickness
I'm used to pain
I hate the sunshine
I love the rain

My mind is recovering
From an overdose
I know that if I blink
The stitches will show
I need the suture
I need the skin
Because I know
That if I don't
The demons will win

(vocalizing)

I don't care if you say I'm pretty
I don't care if you say I'm nice
All I know is when the clock strikes twelve
Nothing is ever right
Because it's midnight

In between today and tomorrow
There is a place where strange things grow
There's no time
There is no stopping
There is no heaven
Cause it's hell

I don't care if you say I'm pretty
I don't care if you say I'm nice
All I know is when the clock strikes twelve
Nothing is ever right
Because it's midnight
