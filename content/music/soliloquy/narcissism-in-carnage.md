## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I can barely hear the screams
Since I'm trapped inside a dream
Of living in a music box
[[unintelligible]] walls and broken parts

I can barely feel the nails
Trying to dig into me
I wish [[unintelligible]] but the music box is all I see
So I pale with grief from all those [[unintelligible]]
My only companion is my mirror

Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage
Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage

I can barely face the wall
It's covered in broken hearts and dolls
I'm doing this for their own good
Making the world be like it should

I can barely hear the [[unintelligible]]
[[unintelligible]]
I can barely see them while I see my visage in their eyes
Here's to locking basement doors
And cleaning bloodstains off your whores

Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage
Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage

It's people like you
Who make people like me
Commit crimes of passion
And plead insanity

It's people like you
Who act just like me
Forget who they are
And destroy all they see

Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage
Narcissism incarnate
Narcissism in carnage

[[unintelligible]] panic stabbed
[[unintelligible]]
[[unintelligible]] epilepsy cannot help me now
