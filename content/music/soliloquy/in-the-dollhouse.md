Caught in a corner
Can you handle the pressure
Are you in denial
Oh, is everything a pleasure
Caught in a nightmare
Covered in black ink
You're just like all of us
You're not so unique

You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
And you can't get away
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
And it's time to play
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now

Bathing in a swamp
You're dipping with pearls
Can you remember why
You were the chosen girl
Are you available
For a little interview
Because I wanna know
What would Jesus do?

You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
And you can't get away
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
Hope you enjoy your stay
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now

Just because I'm made of plastic
Just because you're made of flesh
Doesn't mean it's not as drastic
When my skin is put to the test
Just because my hair is tangled
Just because your eyes are blue
Doesn't mean that I can't strangle
A perfect little bitch like you
A perfect human bitch like you

You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
And you can't get away
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
And it's time to play
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse
You're in the doll
You're in the dollhouse now
