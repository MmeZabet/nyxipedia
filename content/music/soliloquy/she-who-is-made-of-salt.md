## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I wound so easily
Bruises and cuts abound
I cry so readily
Yet it's without a sound
No hands to hold me now
No words to still my heart
Won't someone tell me please
Why I'm falling apart

She who is made of salt
She who is made of salt
I know it's all my fault
Because I'm made of salt

I want to scream and shout
I want to take a stand
I don't know what about
Nor do I have a plan
You are not listening
I have nothing to say
But will you please pay attention
Anyway

She who is made of salt
She who is made of salt
I know it's all my fault
Because I'm made of salt

Bind her wrists
Cover her eyes
She can't go outside
We might have to hide
If you don't wanna die
This'll hurt a tiny bit
And don't you worry pet
It'll be a little prick
Do make the bindings fit

She who is made of salt
She who is made of salt
I know it's all my fault
Because I'm made of salt
