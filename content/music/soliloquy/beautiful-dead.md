So.  Um, this is a song I wrote when I was an angry teenager.  And I mean extremely angry teenager.  I was an angry-ass teenager.  I'm gonna be playing you a song that I wrote when, I believe, I was maybe fifteen.  And, um, yeah.  Let's get started.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
There's hookers in the bathroom
There's blood up on the wall
My screams are full of silence
Police out in the hall
Your body lays there sleeping
With breath enduring sweet
I knew you were my gateway
My sickly sugar treat

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead

Your memory is leering
Your heart is finally stopped
Reporters are annoying
Rumor's that you joy popped
Why did I have to do it?
Why did you have to run?
You wanted to be famous
Now I'm the famous one

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead

(vocalizing)

I wanted you to be
Everything that you could be
I wanted you to stay
But now
You're dead to me

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
I'm the one who said you'd look beautiful dead
