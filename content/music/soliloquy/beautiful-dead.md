## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
There's hookers in the bathroom
There's blood up on the wall
The screams are full of silence
Police are in the hall
Your body lays there sleeping
With breath enduring sweet
I knew you were my gateway
My sickness sugar treat

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead

Your memory is leering
Your heart is finally stopped
Reporters are annoying
[[unintelligible]] joy popped
Why did I have to do it?
Why did you have to run?
You wanted to be famous
Now I'm the famous one

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead

(vocalizing)

I wanted you away
Everything that you could be
I wanted you to stay
But now
You're dead to me

Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Blood on the bed
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
Beautiful dead
I'm the one who said you look beautiful dead
