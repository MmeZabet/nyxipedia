{{< lyrics >}}
You tell me to realize
I've got to grow up some time
Someone won't be there to bail me out every time
But we need to stick together
Because we all love each other
And we have to try everything to stay alive

Turn off the light
I'll be fine
I know I will be alright
And as long
As you're near
I know will be right here
It'll all
Be okay
Tomorrow is another day
I will be fine

Turn off the light
I'll be fine
I know I will be alright
And as long
As you're near
I know will be right here
It'll all
Be okay
Tomorrow is another day
I will be fine
Will you?

But when it feels they've got you down
And it seems no one's around
Remember I'll be here to fix the fronw
Don't cry sister, that's my fault
And when it seems I've messed it all
You feel you are lost
Well you've been found

Turn off the light
I'll be fine
I know I will be alright
And as long
As you're near
I know will be right here
It'll all
Be okay
Tomorrow is another day
I will be fine

Turn off the light
I'll be fine
I know I will be alright
And as long
As you're near
I know will be right here
It'll all
Be okay
Tomorrow is another day
I will be fine
Will you?

Turn out the light
I will be fine

Turn out the light

I will be fine
I'll be alright
And you can turn out the light now
