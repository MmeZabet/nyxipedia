## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
No, I've never said it wasn't true
Delilah, dear, I'm still in love with you
I see so much of me in your excuse
You're long gone so really what's the use?

And you'll never
Listen to this record
So it doesn't matter
If I tell them all what happened, right?
And you'll never
Say I will respect her
So I can finally get it out of me what you did that night

Should I let them know how far it went?
How far it was gonna go?
Should I let them know under the ice how deep the river flows?
Should I let them know the words you said?
So sweet, so soft, so slow
Should I tell them?
Should I tell them?
Should I tell them you didn't say no?

No, I never said it was a lie
Delilah, dear, I swore I wouldn't cry
But you can't help what you feel sometimes
So I took your distance as a sign

And you'll never
Listen to this record
So it doesn't matter
If I tell them what you did to me
And you'll never
Say I will respect her
So I can suck the poison out, bottle it for all to see

Should I let them know how far it went?
How far it was gonna go?
Should I let them know under the ice how deep the river flows?
Should I let them know the words you said?
So sweet, so soft, so slow
Should I tell them?
Should I tell them?
Should I tell them you didn't say no?
Delilah Mayfair, you didn't say no
(x3)
