## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Today
I saw sight that makes me love you the most
Today
I saw the signs that point me back to you
Today
In your eyes I needn't look close
Today
I heard a voice that made my [[unintelligible]]
I like you better when you aren't trying
When you are talking about things you love and truly smiling
I like you better when you're just being
and laughing
and glowing
and seeing

Today
My heart re-broke when you walked out the door
Today
I read the words between the faded lines
Today
I thought I didn't want you anymore
Today
I realized that I tell myself all the best lies
I like you better when you aren't trying
When you are talking about things you love and truly smiling
I like you better when you're just being
and laughing
and glowing
and seeing

Today
I realized I'm lost without you behind me
Though I will move on
I'd rather have you beside me
I'll go and change
I'll rearrange the puddles in my flowers
But when I come back to life
The only love I'll want is ours
Oh

I like you better
I like you better
I like you better when you're mine

You'll like me better in time

I like you better when you're mine

You'll like me better in time
