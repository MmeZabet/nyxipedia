Bettie Page posters line his room
He wakes up to them every day
He has two games on the floor
Never at attention in class
On our dates he doesn't pay
He's already out the door

Cause Grand Theft is his future
And the chicks on his computer
They support his life
Must admit it's kind of sad
While he's busy playing that game
I am making my claim to fame
And I'm ready to suggest the fact
His life has been had
Cause I know he doesn't want much more
Than videogames and porn
Videogames and porn

Only looks at my chest when he talks to me
Only likes me when I wear tight shirts
I am sick of all his shit
He doesn't pay attention when I talk
He tells me to wear mini-skirts
Oh what the hell
Forget this

Cause Grand Theft is his future
And the chicks on his computer
They support his life
Must admit it's kind of sad
While he's busy playing that game
I am making my claim to fame
And I'm ready to suggest the fact
His life has been had
Cause I know he doesn't want much more
Than videogames and porn
Videogames and porn

Gotta tell him it's over
Gotta tell him we're over

Over

Cause Grand Theft is his future
And the chicks on his computer
They support his life
Must admit it's kind of sad
While he's busy playing that game
I am making my claim to fame
And I'm ready to suggest the fact
His life has been had
Cause I know he doesn't want much more
Than videogames and porn
Videogames and porn

No wonder I like girls
