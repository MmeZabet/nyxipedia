{{< lyrics >}}
You coulda said anything
But what you said
Was "I love you"
You coulda done anything
But what you did
Was just cold blooded

You fucking hypocrite
Aristocatic masochist
Pretty boy, you're full of shit
Feel free to watch me
Watch me walk away

You shouldn't have lied to me
Your chance is through
It doesn't matter
What tricks you try with me
I'm on to you
No more nice girl

You fucking hypocrite
Aristocratic masochist
Pretty boy, you're full of shit
Feel free to watch me
Watch me walk away

It's enough to be better
That you love me just the same
You are a little different
Since I learned about the game
You're playing with the master
Of deceit, conceit, and tricks
So plan for your disaster
Cause this little game is fixed

You fucking hypocrite
Aristocratic masochist
Pretty boy, you're full of shit
Feel free to watch me
Watch me watch me

You fucking hypocrite
Aristocratic masochist
Pretty boy, you're full of shit
Feel free to watch me
Watch me walk away
