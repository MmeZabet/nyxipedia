## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Can you see past angel faces
Read between the lines, the spaces
Tell you all about the nature of the beast

Trapped under these golden locks
Are wind up gears and ticking clocks
Sirens echo off when it's time for us to sing

What a precious little girl
Does her name mean devil?
Because I know
Behind her eyes
She was just like all the rest of them
And can you see her snicker madly
I'll destroy her, more than gladly
I am greatest of the [[unintelligible]]

Do you see her sneak behind me?
Telling us, "Never mind me"
But I know that when that we're not looking she stares

Her tell-tale heart beats beneath my floor
Hope the cops don't hear it when I open the door
Her petticoat is caught beneath the planks
[[unintelligible]]

What a pretty girl she was
Her name surely meant devil
Because I know
Behind her eyes
She was just like all the rest of them
