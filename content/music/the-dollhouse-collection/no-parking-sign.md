A couple days ago, I wrote a post about how I became a clown.  And, um, this song is actually kind of about the girl that turned me into a clown. ... I met this girl at an erotic art expo, and she was dressed like a clown.  And she told me I would look cute as a clown.  And, at the same time, I was kind of...  I wasn't really dating this guy.  I had moved to Michigan, because of my high school boyfriend who broke up with me the week after prom.  Um.  Like a month before I was supposed to move out to Michigan. ... So, I was living with my dad in this house I felt completely alien around, and I was trying to convince this dude that had broken up with me to, I guess, start fucking me again?  I don't really know, 'cause he was like a stringy little high school boy, and honestly, who cares?  But, I was obsessed with him.  And um, I-- whilst I was trying to court this young gentleman, I met my clown girl.  And this song was for him, but it mentions her.  Um, as a sin.  And I don't think-- I-- I don't think the sin was being with the clown girl.  I don't think my circus girl was the sin.  I think the sin was me trying to force myself in this suburban Michigan life that I did not absolutely belong in.  And I was right to choose the circus girl.  But...  let's visit nineteen-year-old Kate.

## Lyrics

There is a no 
Parking sign I’m
Sitting by it late at night
Back in time when
You were mine this
Spot was cause for such delight
We would sit here in the dark
Kissing and turning off our phones
You’d skip around me
Down the street when
You got up to walk me home

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

She was there when
You were not I
Couldn’t help myself and I tried
To pretend it’s
Not my fault but
Always seem to catch my lies
No matter the circumstance
I have committed several sins
I’ve been like this with
Every man and
Just want to begin again

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-dum-da-dum

I’m not the girl I was
The girl I wasn’t is here to stay
I’m not the girl you want
The girl you want is far away
But I’m sure she’ll be okay

I’m sure I’ll be okay
