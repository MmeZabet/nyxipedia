## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
In the sight of faerie eyes
You look at the magenta skies
Sunsets just for us
Just you and me

Can you see the clouds so pink?
Here in our glass mosaic sink
They rain down just for us
Just you and me
In our licorice tree

It's all for us
It's all just ours
As we wear crowns of sparkling flowers
It's all for us
For you and I
We can ride away on fireflies
Fireflies

The candy droplets kiss our skin
In this lovely dream that we are in
They touch only us
Just you and me
Can you see the glittering glade
As we drink rainbow lemonade
It glitters just for us
Just you and me
In our licorice tree

It's all for us
It's all just ours
As we wear crowns of sparkling flowers
It's all for us
For you and I
We can ride away on fireflies
Fireflies

I show you this realm anew
It was made just for me and you
I made it just for us
For you and me
I made a licorice tree
