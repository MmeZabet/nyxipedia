A collection of miscellaneous tracks, audio sketches, demos, and what have you, for the sake of providing myself with some financial relief in these coming weeks. I'm hoping that sales of this chaotic time capsule will help me quit my horrible dayjob and keep food on my table and a roof over my head while I look for a new one.
