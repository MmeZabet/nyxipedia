{{< lyrics >}}
"Come on, it'll make you feel good," is what the woman said
Here in a seedy bathroom stall with nails painted solid red
She sprinkled dust along the ground and said, "Here, now you try"
I knelt down on the tile floor, and then I

I fucking love Jesus
He makes everything okay
He takes all my problems
And shoots them with his death ray
I fucking love Jesus
He makes everything go fine
He takes all my problems
And blows them up with his mind

He handed me a razor blade and said, "It's not that hard"
Just a little painless scrape, you're left with brand new scars
Look at the running water in the sink there by my side
I closed my eyes, stuck out my arm, and then I

I'm fucking love Jesus
He makes everything okay
He takes all my problems
And shoots them with his death ray
I fucking love Jesus
He makes everything go fine
He takes all my problems
And blows them up with his mind

I really really really really fucking love Jesus
I really really really really fucking love Jesus
I really really really really fucking love Jesus
I really really really really fucking love Jesus
