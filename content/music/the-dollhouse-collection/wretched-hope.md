{{< lyrics >}}
Don't give up, Hayley Jane, he'll fall in love yet
You need longer hair, but smoke less cigarettes
Maybe if you try hard enough
Maybe if you act smart enough

So, put on your make-up, an impressive disguise
You'll not need much more than your packet of lies
Propaganda for the masses
Watching as the short time passes

Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're real
Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're here

Don't give up little girl, there's still a small hope
Amongst the old shackles, the stone, and the rope
Just another crucifixion
It's not salvation, it's just addiction

You'll need some more paper, you'll need a new pen
Because when you're down there, there's no coming back
Kiss him once before he goes
You pretend that he could know

Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're real
Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're here
You're here

Paint the roses red
With a lover's blood
Let's hope she isn't dead
Or she cannot love
Cut the cord and run
Let's hope she stays alive
Living is twice the fun
When you know you're gonna die
You're gonna die.

Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're real
Maybe he will get the idea
He'll finally see that you're here
You're here
I'm here
