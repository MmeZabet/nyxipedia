## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Welcome to my delusional mind
My reality is left behind
In my head I'm doing fine
With my daisy chain and lyre
I think that we are meant to last
My heart's accepted you too fast
But who cares?
In my head
Forever's possible

This is a song
For you and me
This is a song
About how we are meant to be
This is a song
For no goodbye
This is a song
About forever you and I
You and I

My life is planned and there's the door
I've never felt like this before
Can't love anyone else anymore
So here's to you you my love
I think we're good
Our lives are packed
Are you ready for this?
I love you, Zac
My future isn't quite with yours
So here we go again

This is a song
For you and me
This is a song
About how we are meant to be
This is a song
For no goodbye
This is a song
About forever you and I
You and I

Welcome my delusional mind
Where reality is left behind
In my head I'm doing fine
With my love and my guitar
I think we're good
Our lives are packed
Are you ready for this?
I love you, Zac
The future's what you make it
Forever's possible

This is a song
For you and me
This is a song
About how we are meant to be
This is a song
For no goodbye
This is a song
About forever you and I
You and I
