There's a tick of a clock
As I lie upon a table
That is hard as a rock
And isn't quite too stable
And I cover my eyes
Shielding me from the world
And they tell the toymaker
Fix the girl

He saws into my chest
To see what is the matter
He says he'll do his best
As my heart pitter-patters
And he tries to decide
Whether to give it a whirl
You say "Pretty please, toymaker"
"Fix the girl"

He asks them what's wrong
And they tell him quite clearly
That I speak for too long
And I'm acting quite queerly
And they hate how I dress
And they're getting annoyed
At this rate they know I'll never
Find a boy

Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl

So he picks up his needle
And he sews me together
And he looks at the confused people
That have already gathered
He says "I'm sorry there are so many"
"Like you in the world"
"There really is no need to"
"Fix this girl"

Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl

Oh!

Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
Fix the girl, toymaker
Fix the girl
