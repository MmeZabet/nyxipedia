## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Please like (like! like!)
And subscribe (subscribe)
We can't guarantee it's worth it; you won't know if you don't try
And before (before)
We say goodbye (goodbye)
There is one more little thing, to help us out, if you don't mind;
To show us you really care
Give this video a share
And though we are sad to watch you go,
We'll see you in the comments down below!

(spoken)
Moxie: I like singing with you, Kate.
Kate: I like singing with you too, Moxie.
