welcome to the ratrace racetrack honey
where you gonna put that put that money
you look like you could use some help
maybe you should learn to help yourself

you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine

but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine
but i say bet in on the bootstraps

bad luck never looked so good
prettiest pauper in the neighborhood
man down, stand down, please, god, take the pain
turns out god doesnâ€™t take medicaid

you can bet it all on duloxetine
on yoga, cyclobenzaprine

but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on DBT
on diet, prayer, and therapy
but i say bet in on the bootstraps

have faith in yourself
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
and trust no one else
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
have faith in yourself
[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]
and trust no one
and trust no one else

bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
you can bet it all on DBT
on diet, prayer, and therapy
but i say bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
bet it on the bootstraps
