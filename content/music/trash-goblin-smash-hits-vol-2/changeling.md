## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
take me back under the mound
i am lost and can’t be found
take me back under the mound
i am lost


i don’t belong here
i don’t belong here
i’ve felt it for a long time
something’s going on here
i don’t remember
I don’t remember
you say it was just yesterday
but it seems like forever

take me back under the mound
i am lost and can’t be found
take me back under the mound
i am lost

my flesh betrays me
it disobeys me
pretending i’m not gossamer
has gutted and fileted me
i can’t surrender
i don’t remember
you say it’s been a couple months
but it feels like forever


take me back under the mound
i am lost and can’t be found
take me back under the mound
i am lost

i am lost
in ironside

take me back under the mound
i am lost and can’t be found
take me back under the mound
i am lost
