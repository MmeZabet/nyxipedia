{{< lyrics >}}
Pretty girl, pretty girl
You're more than just pretty, girl
You will take this city, girl
You will save the world
They will love you for your heart
They will love you for your art
I'll love you till I fall apart
My pretty, pretty girl

You can't see it but I know
I see it as I watch you grow
I pray that time will start to slow
I pray the world stands still
So I can save this in my head
As I tuck you into bed
I never want to forget
I pray I never will

You teach me something every day
I watch you dance and watch you play
As I wipe your tears away
I see you standing tall
You are more than what they think
Like books are more than pad and ink
You're more than just the color pink
You can do it all
