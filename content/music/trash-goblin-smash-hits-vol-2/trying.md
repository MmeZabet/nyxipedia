## Background
This was made in fall of 2017, at the height of my chronic illness thus far.

## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
(spoken)
That's right
Another white girl with Garageband

(sung)
I wanna share with you the truth of truths
[[unintelligible]], and so what have I got to lose?
Vulnerable is valiant with the right coat of paint
So who says that I have to learn restraint

I wanna share with you my heart of hearts
Just stitch me up so I can't come apart
So crucify me for the sake of art
It's what I need so I can start
My path to progress, it isn't a straight line
And if you say "how are you?" I can still say "doin' fine"
But it's not the truth so why waste the time
My brain's a little fuzzy and they won't be pretty lies

I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
God knows I'm trying

I wanna share with you some of the pain
Cause I can't handle this all by myself
I realize I'm repeating my refrain
But I can't talk to anybody else
I wanna share so I am not alone
I wanna share so you are not alone
I wanna share cause we are not alone
And we can't do all of this on our own
There's strength in weakness, and I am getting stronger
Remind myself that the path it don't get longer
I keep getting trapped by my "haven'ts" and "nevers"
It's dark right now but this won't be forever

I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
God knows I'm trying

My path to progress, it isn't a straight line
And if you say "how are you?" I can still say "doin' fine"
But it's not the truth so why waste the time
My brain's a little fuzzy and they won't be pretty lies

There's strength in weakness, and I am getting stronger
Remind myself that the path it don't get longer
I keep getting trapped by my have beens and nevers
It's dark right now but this won't be forever

I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
God knows I'm trying
I'm trying
