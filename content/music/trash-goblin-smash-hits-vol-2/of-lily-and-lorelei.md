Lily was a good girl, she wore white cotton lace
Never did you see her without a smile on her face
She was marrying an artist with a heart of gold
She loved him for his smile and the stories that he told

Lorelei, her sister, wasn't such a pleasant dame
She wore dark sunglasses and laughed at those in pain
She saw Lily's fiancee waiting for her by the stairs
Stripped him in a second, and danced away without a care

Lorelei, my love
Lorelei, my love
I could never love you
like the pain you cause does.

The fiancee was a wreck from that day on, or so I hear
Just waiting for a whisper from Lorelei in his ear
Lily never knew about the deed her sister did
When she tried to kiss him, her fiancee ran and hid

Lorelei watched as the scene played before her eyes
The smile on her face being her only disguise
She sidled up beside him and she said to him sweetly
"Isn't it ironic how I've ruined you completely?"

Lorelei, my love
Lorelei, my love
I could never love you
like the pain you cause does

Lorelei, my love
Lorelei, my love
I could never love you
like the pain you cause does.

Lily was a good girl, she wore white cotton lace
Never did you see her without a smile on her face
She was marrying an artist with a heart so freshly torn
By Lorelei, her sister, and the sunglasses she wore.
