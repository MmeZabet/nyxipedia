{{< lyrics >}}
woke up crying out in pain
taking the lord’s name in vain
went to the doctor, he said “no,
i can’t see it, it’s not so,
you’re just thinking so damn hard
pretty thing, you’re seeing stars
take a rest, this will subside”
he thinks that I’m telling lies
i can see it in his eyes

awooo
she is crying wolf, she’s just crying wolf

she might be sick but i’ve seen sicker
why smoke grass when you’ve got liquor
why drink gin when whiskey’s sweeter
why pay paul when you stillill owe peter
why say red when you mean grey
why say go when you mean stay
why purr when you want to growl
why wait, sister, do it now,
bare your teeth and howl

awooo
she is crying wolf, she’s just crying wolf

wounded but i do not bleed
how can i heal what i can’t see
wounded but they don’t believe
how can i heal what i can’t see

awooo
she is crying wolf, she’s just crying wolf
