## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
I won't be quiet
I won't be ignored
I've had it with your lies and
Won't wait around for more
You tell me that you love me
You tell me I'm adored
But your actions speak much louder than your money can afford

I won't be silent
I will not lay down
I said I won't be quiet
Now listen to the sound
I'm sure you think you know me
Your pretty little clown
But I am no one's fool, you hear?
So stop foolin' around

Money talks, bullshit walks
So you can say you're sorry but it's still your fault
Yeah, you promise
Sure, you're honest
You can say your sorry, but your money money money won't talk
Yeah, you can say your sorry, but your money money money won't talk

I'm finally angry
It has been too long
My soul is sick and hungry
From righting all your wrongs
I want to go to sleep but
I have to write this song
Cause I'm a survivor and the show must go on

Money talks, bullshit walks
So you can say you're sorry but it's still your fault
Yeah, you promise
Sure, you're honest
You can say your sorry, but your money money money won't talk
Yeah, you're sorry sorry sorry, but your money money money won't talk
Yeah, you're sorry sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry

Don't ya think
Think it's funny
You can talk but
Not your money
Don't ya think
Think it's funny
That you can talk
But not your money, nah

Money talks, bullshit walks
So you can say you're sorry but it's still your fault
Yeah, you promise
Sure, you're honest
You can say your sorry, but your money money money won't talk
Yeah, you're sorry sorry sorry, but your money money money won't talk
