## Lyrics
{{< lyrics >}}
Want to climb in your balloon and look out at the world
Two young lovers holding hands inside two little girls
Maybe it's my scrambled brain, or the glitter in my eyes
I always felt unstoppable with you there by my side

You're opposite the sun so I thought you fit the color scheme
I'm a midwest midwife with East Coast memories
Painting all my features with colors that are yours
Kept on when I left you for boy I once adored
And he took everything I had
I asked you to give it back
To fill the space he once was in
With rainbow lemonade and gin

I want to meet the challenges that I could never meet
I want to climb a mountain with green high tops on my feet
To see Philadelphia amidst the smoky haze
To witness all our bridges going up in flames

I wanna paint a portrait of a world only we can see
Beneath cotton candy clouds and our licorice tree
Even after all the time we were scattered by
I still feel unstoppable with your music in my mind
And I want to travel back in time
To see Bob Dylan in his prime
To fill the space we should be in
With rainbow lemonade and gin

Maybe it's the time of year
Makes me wish that you were here
I try to fill the empty space
With gin and rainbow lemonade
