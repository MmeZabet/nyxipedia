Lullaby Lounge (Choose Your Own Adventure Edition)

{{< youtube id="ubSPf7ZXR5M" >}}

Aired: 2020-02-20

This episode is abnormally short due to technical difficulties.  Presumably it kept going, but the YouTube version ends during the midroll.  This show was played significantly earlier in the day than normal and on a Thursday because Kate had a scheduling conflict at normal showtime.  The way the setlist was set up is that Kate picked a bunch of songs in advance and randomized the order via die rolling during the show.

### Setlist
* Black Sky Lullaby - Kate Nyx
* Clint Eastwood - Gorillaz
* Kiss From a Rose - Seal
* Heroine - Kate Nyx

The following songs were also on the setlist, but the order they were played in is unknown:
* Diagnonsense - Kate Nyx
* Mein Herr - Liza Minnelli
* The Best You Had By Far - Kate Nyx
* Purgatory - Kate Nyx
