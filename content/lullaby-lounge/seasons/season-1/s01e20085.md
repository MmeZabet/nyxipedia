Lullaby Lounge: Power Up Edition

{{< youtube id="4XN2QEh8nKo" >}}

Aired: 2020-03-25

This episode's theme was about powering up and using music to do so.  One notable moment was when Kate played Pretty Girl, she did so on guitar, and a significant portion of the song was more upbeat and intense.

I'm very glamourous, in that I sweat constantly and I smell terrible.
