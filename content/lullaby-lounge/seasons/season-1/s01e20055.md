This show was the week of PAX, and Kate was slammed with getting ready for it.  At the start, Kate talked a bit about her guitar Melissa, a limited-edition Ovation slimline acoustic.  In the middle, famed wrestler Ophidian the Cobra busted onto the set and stopped the show to put Kate through a training montage featuring Smacktalk Showdown, a game she'd be playing on stage at PAX a few days after this show.
