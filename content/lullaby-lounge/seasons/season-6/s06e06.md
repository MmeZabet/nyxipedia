Corporate Sponsor Presents THE LULLABY LOUNGE NOVELTY HOUR

{{< youtube id="t51qx49M37E" >}}

This week, Corporate Sponsor granted Kate access to the satellites again, allowing her to grace us with her show.  In return, she had to make some...  changes.  However, something sinister seemed to be afoot.  The GOOCroo was acting a bit odd, and a message from Sondra broke into the stream at the beginning with an unexpected warning.
