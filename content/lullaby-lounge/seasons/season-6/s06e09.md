SUPER SPOOKY SERIES FINALE - In Loving Memory of The Lullaby Lounge

{{< youtube id="zTg5M-WOONw" >}}

Dom rest ye, Lullaby Lounge.  In an extra long, extra spooky send off to the coziest concert in cyberspace, Kate puts on a show filled with the usual brand of magic that only she and Ophidian can bring to the table.  In classic form, unexpected technical difficulties left the chroma key enabled, treating the viewers to the sight of a Fraug with a digitally superimposed logo over him.  We got a wonderful series of behind the scenes clips to celebrate an incredible run as well.
