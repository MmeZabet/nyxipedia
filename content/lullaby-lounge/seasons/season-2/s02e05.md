Is that a huge cup or am I tiny?  I am a medium-sized lady.  This is a huge cup.  I would say...  I have a very large head.  Like...  I have an extra large head.  Um.  For those of you that do not know, I have the same size head as, like, like a 300 pound adult man.  I have an extra large brain.  Sondra!  I got this at the dollar store by our house!  We got one for my husband too!  We have matching.  They're green on the outside and brown on the inside, which is just supreme for me, because like it matches me exactly.

(Ophidian, off-camera:  "You're implying your insides are brown?")
...Everybody's insides are brown.  That's where the blood lives!  ...Are you gonna be full peanut gallery for this situation?
