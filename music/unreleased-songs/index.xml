The title is not necessarily final. I am not a prayer person. I don&amp;rsquo;t, like, talk out loud to a deity very often. I have maybe a few times. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know that I believe in a deity. I believe that witchcraft has power over us because we believe in it, which I think is true of basically anything.</description></item><item><title>Too Good to be True</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/too-good-to-be-true/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/too-good-to-be-true/</guid><description>Too Good to be True # Background # It&amp;rsquo;s unknown if this is the correct name of this song.

Lyrics # I can feel it crawling up my throatI can feel it begging me to take overSuddenly it's threatening to chokeI sound like I'm sky high when I'm stone cold soberAnd my face is turning redAnd there's burning in my headI've still got some learning left to doShe's so pretty I could dieSo much prettier than IComparison's the death of joyBut you're too good to be trueI see in the comments that you're lovedI see strangers promise that they're your backupGod, your public just can't get enoughI guess I just happen to be Little Miss Bad LuckAnd my eyes are turning greenMy psyche is a murder sceneWhy do I want to be mean to you?</description></item><item><title>Untitled Faerie/Mermaid Song</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/untitled-faerie-mermaid-song/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/untitled-faerie-mermaid-song/</guid><description>Untitled Faerie/Mermaid Song # Background # During S01E20064, Kate was commissioned to create a brief song.
