Lyrics # I can feel it crawling up my throatI can feel it begging me to take overSuddenly it's threatening to chokeI sound like I'm sky high when I'm stone cold soberAnd my face is turning redAnd there's burning in my headI've still got some learning left to doShe's so pretty I could dieSo much prettier than IComparison's the death of joyBut you're too good to be trueI see in the comments that you're lovedI see strangers promise that they're your backupGod, your public just can't get enoughI guess I just happen to be Little Miss Bad LuckAnd my eyes are turning greenMy psyche is a murder sceneWhy do I want to be mean to you?</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Facebook</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/welcome-to-facebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/unreleased-songs/welcome-to-facebook/</guid><description>Welcome to Facebook # Background # It&amp;rsquo;s unknown if this is the correct name of this song.

Lyrics # Welcome to FacebookHere are the rulesLeave a comment and a like if you think I'm coolAnd if you think I'm a dumb slutWell, say that tooCause the algorithm doesn't care what you doIf it's got people talkingMust be goodEngagement is key in our neck of the woodsDoesn't matter if there's slurs or threats or rapeIf you're a dude, they don't care what you sayBut better watch your language, ladies and queersCause if you say men are trash, then you're out of hereAlsoNo outside linksDon't talk in all capsThe algorithm doesn't like any of thatSo say something awkwardUse two emojisThat lets Facebook know that you're one of my homiesIf you hit share, make sure you add a captionEncourage your friends to leave their reactionsAs long as we're havin' these interactionsFacebook will know that you're part of the fractionOf people who get to witness the actionLet everyone know that my page is happenin'No, I wanna hear your keyboards clackin'I wanna hear those send keys tappin'Once that's done and the chat gets chattin'You can drop it down and make that ass clap, sonSorry, I mighta gotten carried awayBut you mustn't forget these words I sayIn the Facebook economy, the comment is kingAnd a like might help, but shares give this faerie her wings</description></item></channel></rss>
