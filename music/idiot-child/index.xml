Lyrics # (vocalizing)I can tell from the way you smileThat you think I’m inferiorWhy don't I complain? Because I’m used to you being superiorShe’s a goddess in a blue dressI’m a teenage fantasyThis little thing you can controlWith your domestic rhapsodyAren’t you such a catchWould you like to danceWe’re a new perfect matchA pretty second chanceI can tell from your lack of wordsThat you miss her immeasurablyFor when you were by her sideThe same silence made for meAnd you said not to count my failuresBefore they commenceI’m in love with someone’s loverAnd she makes more senseAren’t you such a catchWould you like to danceWe’re a new perfect matchA pretty second chanceChoose her, please choose herYou can let me goI’d rather be lonely than really never knowChoose her, please choose herI know she makes you singBaby this will work when I’m your everything(bum bum bum)But you’re such a catchWould you like to danceWe’re a new perfect matchA pretty second chance</description></item><item><title>Farewell, Licorice Tree</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/idiot-child/farewell-licorice-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/idiot-child/farewell-licorice-tree/</guid><description>Farewell, Licorice Tree # Background # Lorem Ipsum

I was selling sewing machines at the time, and she and her boyfriend were having some problems because, um, he wanted to be polyamorous, and she did not want to be polyamorous. And I wrote this song for her as a way to sort of get through the difficulties of having those conversations, and, um, just to sort of help her through that time.</description></item></channel></rss>
