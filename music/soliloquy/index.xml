Um. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first songs I wrote that I think was, like, making people&amp;ndash; er, showing my colors as I moved forward. There&amp;rsquo;s these like, sort of, middle songs that either happen on the end of the record, or in between records, like Fix the Girl was sort of the between of To My Sisters&amp;hellip; and Soliloquy.</description></item><item><title>Beautiful Dead</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/soliloquy/beautiful-dead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/soliloquy/beautiful-dead/</guid><description>Beautiful Dead # Background # So. Um, this is a song I wrote when I was an angry teenager. And I mean extremely angry teenager. I was an angry-ass teenager.

Kate Nyx S01E20092 Lyrics # There's hookers in the bathroomThere's blood up on the wallMy screams are full of silencePolice out in the hallYour body lays there sleepingWith breath enduring sweetI knew you were my gatewayMy sickly sugar treatBlood on the bedI'm the one who said you'd look beautiful deadBlood on the bedI'm the one who said you'd look beautiful deadBeautiful deadYour memory is leeringYour heart is finally stoppedReporters are annoyingRumor's that you joy poppedWhy did I have to do it?</description></item><item><title>Blood Imperial [Bury Your Whore]</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/music/soliloquy/blood-imperial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/music/soliloquy/blood-imperial/</guid><description>Blood Imperial [Bury Your Whore] # Background # Lorem Ipsum
