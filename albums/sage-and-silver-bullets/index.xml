Lyrics # Annabelle satNext to the train tracksThe sunset stared backAs she swung her feetAgainst the guard railHer hair in pigtailsEvery tall taleShe told was in her teethHer mother said that fibbers were the devils kin &amp; kindAnd that she wouldn’t get anywhere by telling all those liesBut Annabelle was happier playing in her mindSo she liedOh, she lied.Annabelle satNext to the train tracksThe sky was so blackYou couldn’t see the starsAgainst the stop lightsThe neon bar signsShe knew it was timeTo find a new front yardShe packed her journals &amp; her comb, her necklace made of shellsAnd her mother told her she was going straight to hellBut the devils playground was better than standing stillHey AnnabelleOh, AnnabelleAnnabelle satNext to the train tracksAnd she looked backBut she felt no fearShe said a prayerIt was nowhereIt was somewhereBut it wasn’t hereI have waited all my life to go out on my ownThis place cannot contain me, I don't care if I'm aloneIf travel far enough, the road can feel like homeAnd so I go</description></item><item><title>Bianca</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/bianca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/bianca/</guid><description>Bianca # Background # Lorem Ipsum
Lyrics # It's so easy to go backTo the life that you once hadIt's so god damn hard to changeAnd the feeling's pretty strangeIt's so easy to say yesTo your old conflicted messIt's like a cheap electric shockTo turn back the clockCan't you just say no, Bianca?Can't you let it go, Bianca?I guess I'll never know, BiancaThe things that you go throughIt's like you were never aliveEvery step you take's a diveInto a new uncharted seaWhere we all sit, patientlyPlease don't try to run awayWe're waiting 'til you're okayBefore you forgive anyone elseYou have to forgive yourselfCan't you just say no, Bianca?</description></item><item><title>Black Sky Lullaby</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/black-sky-lullaby/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/black-sky-lullaby/</guid><description>Black Sky Lullaby # Background # Lorem Ipsum

Lyrics # It was predicted by my mother's eyesWith tears that wandered down her faceThat my psyche would be volatileWith several parts misplacedThe section meant for directionNever developed fullyNow ribbons tied to my cortexesFind new places to pull meI say I'm not losing my mindBecause it's running freeIt's travelled long and loathesome hoursTo get away from meIt sits in an unsealed mason jarUpon some official's deskHappy in it's unhappinessAnd finally at restAnd here I sit, without a conscienceBut i have never been at peaceNot technically consciousBut cognitive at leastI say I'm not losing my mindBecause it took a trainThrough North Carolina and New OrleansTo find itself new namesThis addiction that I have is not to any substanceNo nicotine can sway me, no alcohol can numb itI don't adore heroin, I don't fancy cocaineI'm in love to my very core with causing myself painI say I'm not losing my mindBut we know that's a lieIt travelled long and loathsome hoursTo find somewhere to dieLike a cat curled in a cornerUnderneath the basement stairsTo breath its final breath aloneSo you don't have to care.</description></item><item><title>In Your Grave</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/in-your-grave/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/sage-and-silver-bullets/in-your-grave/</guid><description>In Your Grave # Background # Lorem Ipsum
