Lyrics # Romeo was young and he was unfraidJuliet was dumb, easy to serenadeLittle did they know the tragedy of fateStar crossed lovers, happily dismayedAnd I'm not one for suicideAt last not anymoreBut you, my dear, are far too prettyNot to fight a little forArise fair sunAnd slay the envious moonfor she is sick and pale with griefGoodbye, my loveFor I have come too soonAnd you'll not be with meI guess it makes sense, the choice that you madeTo pick Romeo who loved over the Romeo who was afraidBut that doesn't mean I didn't want to stayI just have some priorities to get straightAnd I'm I'm not one for poisonAt least not anymoreBut, girl, you're far too prettyNot to die a little forArise fair sunAnd slay the envious moonfor she is sick and pale with griefGoodbye, my loveFor I have gone too soonAnd you'll not be with meRomeo, romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?</description></item><item><title>As Yet Unnamed</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/the-dollhouse-collection/as-yet-unnamed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/the-dollhouse-collection/as-yet-unnamed/</guid><description>As Yet Unnamed # Background # Lorem Ipsum

Lyrics # You tell me I don't have to worryAs you strap on your holsters and goInto a fray you found in furyBut continued through your need to knowDefining lines as you cross themLeads to misleading mistakesDon't live your life like you've lost himRegret none of the choices you makeCHORUS:You're a warrior of love, stick to your gunsThere will be a time when you fight no longerWhat's wounding you is making you strongerWarrior of loveYou're a warrior of love, stick to your guns,There will be a time when you fight no longerWhat's wounding you really makes you strongerOh, warrior of loveAnd the scars you have from battleStain your eyes and slur your speechYour tears you have shed for shacklesSo you could have him in your reachYou find the symptoms when you stop themYour path is delicate and trueDon't live your life like you've lost himBecause he's who is losing youCHORUSYour company is strongI'm your soldier in songYou are in the right, but there is no wrongWhat you want can be realDon't fear what you feelYou're fighting for a good causeCHORUS</description></item><item><title>Wretched Hope</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/the-dollhouse-collection/wretched-hope/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/the-dollhouse-collection/wretched-hope/</guid><description>Wretched Hope # Background # Lorem Ipsum
Lyrics # Don't give up, Hayley Jane, he'll fall in love yetYou need longer hair, but smoke less cigarettesMaybe if you try hard enoughMaybe if you act smart enoughSo, put on your make-up, an impressive disguiseYou'll not need much more than your packet of liesPropaganda for the massesWatching as the short time passesMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereDon't give up little girl, there's still a small hopeAmongst the old shackles, the stone, and the ropeJust another crucifixionIt's not salvation, it's just addictionYou'll need some more paper, you'll need a new penBecause when you're down there, there's no coming backKiss him once before he goesYou pretend that he could knowMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereYou're herePaint the roses redWith a lover's bloodLet's hope she isn't deadOr she cannot loveCut the cord and runLet's hope she stays aliveLiving is twice the funWhen you know you're gonna dieYou're gonna die.</description></item></channel></rss>
