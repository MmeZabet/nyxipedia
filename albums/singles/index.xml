I think the lyrics speak for themselves; know I mean every single one and that I am singing directly to you. Thanks to the support of my audience over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to cultivate something of a life for myself.</description></item><item><title>BEAN GOTTA SCREAM feat.

Lyrics # It's goin' down. Yo the girl got a gun,Best run.

I will be producing it entirely by myself over the winter; the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m even saying anything is to hold myself accountable.
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot since the creation of my last record, about where my limits lie, and how to navigate them. I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned a lot about producing music over the past few years and am at a point where I think I can make something worthy of releasing on my own.</description></item><item><title>Cheap Thrills COVER</title><link>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/singles/cheap-thrills-cover/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 12:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nyxipedia.com/albums/singles/cheap-thrills-cover/</guid><description>Cheap Thrills COVER # Background # Lorem Ipsum
