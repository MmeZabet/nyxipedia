I will be producing it entirely by myself over the winter; the only reason I\u0026rsquo;m even saying anything is to hold myself accountable.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot since the creation of my last record, about where my limits lie, and how to navigate them. I\u0026rsquo;ve also learned a lot about producing music over the past few years and am at a point where I think I can make something worthy of releasing on my own.\nI plan to re-record some singles and demos I\u0026rsquo;ve released already, as well as several new songs. My hope is to release it in the spring of 2021; I plan to show the process behind the scenes and share any fruits of my labor on my Patreon at www.katenyx.com/join If you\u0026rsquo;re there already you will most likely recognize many of the songs I plan to record.\nIn the meantime, enjoy this fresh take on my 2018 single, Bet it On The Bootstraps. I hope I can come through for myself, and you.\nLyrics #  welcome to the rat race racetrack honeywhere you gonna put that put that moneyyou look like you could use some helpmaybe you should learn to help yourselfyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet in on the bootstrapsbad luck never looked so goodprettiest pauper in the neighborhoodman down, stand down, please, god, take the painturns out god doesn’t take medicaidyou can bet it all on duloxetineon yoga, cyclobenzaprinebut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on DBTon diet, prayer, and therapybut i say bet in on the bootstrapshave faith in yourself[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]and trust no one else[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]have faith in yourself[bet it, bet it, bet it on the bootstraps]and trust no oneand trust no one elsebet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsyou can bet it all on DBTon diet, prayer, and therapybut i say bet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstrapsbet it on the bootstraps "},{"id":26,"href":"/music/sage-and-silver-bullets/calm-down/","title":"Calm Down","section":"Sage and Silver Bullets","content":"Calm Down #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  baby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minei can't wash you off of my skinlook at all the trouble i'm ini can't get you out of my headnever kicked you out of my bedyou saidbaby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minein timeyour disaster burrowed in meand developed into diseasei still see your face in my dreamsthree years passed and i'm still uncleanyou breathedbaby, calm down,baby, calm down,it's gonna be finebaby, calm downbaby, calm down,one day you'll be minein time "},{"id":27,"href":"/music/make-an-entrance-ep/canvas/","title":"CANVAS [The Nouveau Aesthetic Theme]","section":"Make an Entrance EP","content":"CANVAS [The Nouveau Aesthetic Theme] #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  Canvas, the great equalizerTo be painted, to be tainted, by our painIs a still life a full life?It holds no motionNo emotionCanvas [[unintelligible]]Canvas(x4) "},{"id":28,"href":"/music/demolition/card-subject-to-change/","title":"Card Subject to Change [DEMO]","section":"DEMOlition: An Audio Sketchbook","content":"Card Subject to Change [DEMO] #  Background #  Lorem Ipsum\nLyrics #  you said that blonde heels have more funwell, you're living proofi thought that you were the oneso foolish in my youthand the victor for the matchwell, it's pretty cleardarling, you were such a catchuntil you dissappearedbaby i'm a luchador and i learned it from youi fight for freedom and i fight for the truthbaby i'm a luchador and all because of youyou foolyou said you did your bestwell it wasn't good enoughyou put me to the testbut you play a little roughyou say i'm green as earthand fickle as the airbut for what it's worthi finally don't careCHORUSi hate hateto break kay fabebut i got to got to got to sayyou got me pretty good, babyi hate hate HATEto break break breakkay fabebut the gimmick didn't workturns out you're just a jerkCHORUS "},{"id":29,"href":"/lullaby-lounge/cast-and-crew/","title":"Cast and Crew","section":"The Lullaby Lounge","content":"Cast and Crew #  Descriptions of the cast and crew are to follow.
