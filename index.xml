Lyrics # Don't give up, Hayley Jane, he'll fall in love yetYou need longer hair, but smoke less cigarettesMaybe if you try hard enoughMaybe if you act smart enoughSo, put on your make-up, an impressive disguiseYou'll not need much more than your packet of liesPropaganda for the massesWatching as the short time passesMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereDon't give up little girl, there's still a small hopeAmongst the old shackles, the stone, and the ropeJust another crucifixionIt's not salvation, it's just addictionYou'll need some more paper, you'll need a new penBecause when you're down there, there's no coming backKiss him once before he goesYou pretend that he could knowMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're realMaybe he will get the ideaHe'll finally see that you're hereYou're herePaint the roses redWith a lover's bloodLet's hope she isn't deadOr she cannot loveCut the cord and runLet's hope she stays aliveLiving is twice the funWhen you know you're gonna dieYou're gonna die.</description></item></channel></rss>
